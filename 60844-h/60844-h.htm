      the shadow of Campbell mountain, a 1700-foot detachment from lofty Sierra
      Nevada range, 25 miles east of Fresno, on Christmas Day, 1947&#8212;six

      <span class="c0">I am writing on an envelope&#8212;and a used one, at that&#8212;out
      in the open, in Anna&#8217;s and Virginia Anne&#8217;s rose garden, at the

      <span class="c2 c0">Then, too, I want to get in a word about this most
      unusual Christmas Day&#8212;something seldom seen in my cold climate home
      state. As a rule you just don&#8217;t write on a tab out in the open, nor
      pluck roses in the wintertime, back home.</span>

      long-stemmed perfectly developed Radiant Beauty (red) roses from a single
      unprotected plant, the one blooming plant among hundreds, in my rose
      garden in Northeast Kansas. And, to make it appear all the more unusual,
      Radiant Beauty was brought out in 1934 as a hot-house rose. Also, I needed
      a little data&#8212;and I got it from Sam in the rose garden. And this
      seemed the opportune time to write a few lines.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">Besides these two capable assistants, our printing
      office had something no other paper could boast. Our &#8220;itchyfoot&#8221;
      Devil&#8212;for a short time only&#8212;was a personality of high
      adventure. Like Nellie Bly, of (National) magazine fame, and Ed Howe of
      (Atchison) Daily Newspaper fame, Bert Wilson, better known as &#8220;Spike&#8221;
      Wilson, went around the world. But unlike Nellie, backed by a magazine in
      a race against time; and Ed, teeming with newspaper dollars, our &#8220;Spike&#8221;
      bummed his way, with a minimum of work&#8212;mostly dish-washing&#8212;all
      the twenty-five thousand miles around the globe while still in his teens.
      &#8220;Spike&#8221; aspired to become a printer for the advantage it would
      afford him in his desire to see the world. A journeyman printer could
      always get a lift from any country newspaper in those days. Old Busbee,
      Nationally known &#8220;tramp printer&#8221; dropped in on us one time. He
      was given a day&#8217;s work&#8212;and a half-week&#8217;s salary. He
      tried to discourage &#8220;Spike&#8221;&#8212;and maybe he did. But I
      think his woe-begone looks was the greater influence. Busbee came this way
      three times within my recollection. &#8220;Spike&#8221; Wilson was the
      stepson of &#8220;Mule&#8221; Gibbons, who came here with his family from
      Corning in the early 90&#8217;s&#8212;and several years later moved to
      Holton.</span>

      <span class="c0">Wetmore</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was not an excess of water, as one might suppose,
      that gave Wetmore its name. Nor was it, as some have been led to believe,
      because a certain Captain Wetmore, with a number of soldiers during the
      Civil War chanced to camp over night at our ever-flowing mineral spring.
      Art Taylor says his grandmother told him that such was the case.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It has been generally understood all along that the
      town was named after a New York official of the railroad which came
      through here in 1867. Confirmed, this would seem to kill the Taylor
      version of it, by at least two years. The matter, I believe, was settled
      for all time a couple of summers back when a New York woman, returning by
      automobile from the Pacific coast, called at the Wetmore post office to
      mail some letters. She told Postmaster Jim Hanks that the town was named
      after her father, who was an official of the railroad&#8212;and that she
      had driven a hundred miles out of her way to have her letters bear the
      Wetmore postmark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I have seen Wetmore grow&#8212;and slip. Compact at
      the time of my entry seventy-nine years ago, occupying less than a half
      block, the town spread out through the years to a space of one-half mile
      by nearly one mile&#8212;not quite solid. The town became a City in 1884,
      with Dr. J. W. Graham as first Mayor&#8212;and at its peak had a
      population 687. The population at this time&#8212;1948&#8212;is 373.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There is not a person in this City today who was here
      when I came. Gone, all gone now. And nearly all dead. Something more than
      a tinge of sadness accompanies this thought. There is not a building of
      any kind standing that was here when I came&#8212;not a tree but what has
      been planted since that day. In truth, there is nothing, not a thing left,
      save the eternal hills and the creek which flows through the south edge of
      the City that antedates the time I came here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Yet, I do not feel old. And should any of my friends
      choose to wish me anything, let them wish with me that I never do grow
      old.</span>

      <span class="c9 c0">The Mineral Spring</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">To enlarge a bit on our ever-flowing mineral spring! It
      was&#8212;and is&#8212;near the creek in a natural grove of big trees at
      the southwest limits of Wetmore. Nathaniel Morris, an early-day merchant,
      had an analysis of the water made&#8212;and talked of developing the
      spring into a health resort. The water was pronounced medicinally good</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">mostly iron, I believe. But,
      beyond attracting large celebration crowds, his dream was never realized.
      However, Morris induced the railroad to run in an &#8220;excursion&#8221;
      train of flat-cars canopied with heavy-foliaged brush against a blazing
      summer sun, on the occasion of one Fourth of July celebration. Green
      leafed brush also covered some of the stands on the south margin of the
      grove. Green brush was the standard picnic coverings in those days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, later, Charley Locknane, Jay W. Powers, and Jim
      Liebig, undertook to popularize the spring&#8212;and incidentally, make
      some money for themselves. They invested considerable money in
      improvements. Locknane was a budding promoter with considerable nerve&#8212;and
      a pull with the railroad. He caused a special excursion train to be run
      out from Kansas City, $1.50 fare for the round trip. Also, Charley
      organized a Girl Band of twenty pieces, which furnished music for the
      opening picnic&#8212;and many occasion thereafter. The Girl Band gained
      national acclaim. Locknane was State Deputy for the Modern Woodmen of
      America&#8212;and took his Girl Band to the Head Camp at Colorado Springs
      in 1901, and to Minneapolis in 1902. The members were: Dora Geyer, Mollie
      Neely, Nora Shuemaker, Mabel Geyer, Phoena Liebig, Iva Hudson, Daisy
      Terry, Blanche Eley, Kate Searles, Truda Berridge, Edith Lapham, Pearl
      Nance, Maude Cole, Jennie Scott, Belle Searles, Grace Maxwell, Ruby Nance,
      Myrtle Graham, Mrs. Ella Rice and Mrs. Carrie Glynn, of McLouth, Kansas,
      were numbers five and six in the line-up as written on the back of an
      enlarged photograph now in possession of Mrs. P. G. Worthy&#8212;formerly
      Myrtle Graham.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The dance pavilion was well patronized between
      celebrations&#8212;and the town populace turned out of evenings for a
      stroll to the spring. It was really popular. Then a flood, an unusually
      big flood, swept the park clean of all improvements. The large frame
      dance-hall came to anchor on a projection of land on the present Bill
      Winkler farm nearly a mile down the creek. The town jester said that as
      the pavilion floated away the piano was automatically playing &#8220;Over
      the Ocean Waves.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The mineral spring is still here&#8212;but that&#8217;s
      all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At one of the big celebrations about the turn of the
      century a farmer brought his family to town in a spring wagon. He tied his
      team on the town-side of the picnic grounds, leaving a three-year-old
      child asleep in the wagon. When the parents returned after taking in the
      picnic, the child was gone. Then the picnickers began a search which
      lasted throughout the night. All roads were covered for four or five miles
      out. One searching party went four miles west on the railroad track&#8212;then
      turned back, believing a small child could not travel that far. The
      section men out Wetmore found the mangled body of the child in a small
      wash by the side of the railroad about a half-mile beyond the point
      abandoned by the searchers. An early morning freight train had bumped it
      off a low bridge. Then there was much speculation as to how a small child
      could have traveled that far&#8212;even hints, unwarranted suspicion, of
      foul help. Then there was a story afloat about the conductor whose train
      had struck the child. When told of the killing, it was claimed, he cried
      and said had he known a child was lost along the track he would have
      walked ahead the train.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">There was one general store owned by Morris Brothers.
      Uliam Morris, with his wife Eliza and daughter Nannie, and his brother
      Nathaniel, lived over the store. Kirk Wood had a blacksmith shop, a small
      home, his wife Euphemia and two children, Riley and Jay. Kirk&#8217;s
      brother Jay lived with the family. M. P. M. Cassity, lawyer, owned his
      home and rental house, had a wife&#8212;off and on&#8212;and a son,
      George. Martin Peter Moses Cassity&#8217;s second marriage with his
      Griselle (Wheeler), the birth of Eddie, and the final parting, were after

      <span class="c0">James Neville, section foreman, had a residence, his wife

      Mahlen. Dominic Norton, section hand, had six motherless children</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Anna, Kate, Bridget, Ellen,
      Mollie, and Michael. Mike Smith, a plasterer, lived with the Nortons in
      the section house. Ursula Maxwell, a widow, with her son Granville and
      daughter Lizzie, lived in her own home. Ursula&#8217;s daughter Maggie,
      married to Jim Cardwell, was also temporarily in her home at this time.
      Samuel Slossen was building a hotel. He had a wife and a son, George. And
      there was a railroad station, and an agent named Catlin. Also a school
      house, and a teacher&#8212;John Burr.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The family of Peter Isaacson, deceased, in a farm home
      separated from the town by a street, were considered as town folk. Here
      lived the mother (married to A. Anderson) and four of her children&#8212;Andy,
      Edward, Irving, and Matilda. Anderson had two children, Oscar and Emily,
      living in the home. William and Alma were born later.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Matilda Isaacson, a very pretty girl, later, married
      Alfred Hazeltine. By reason of his living in a farm home on the opposite
      side of town, Alfred was also considered as belonging. Well, in fact,
      Alfred did live in town several years prior to his marriage. We roomed
      together at the Overland Hotel when he was engaged in business, partner in
      the Buzan, Hazeltine &amp; Hough Lumber Company, and I was clerking in
      Than Morris&#8217; store. Our family was then</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">ten years after first coming to Wetmore&#8212;doing a
      three-year stretch on a portion of the Charley Hazeltine farm west of
      Alfred&#8217;s place, beyond the timber on the south side of the creek.
      And I was working out a store bill. Father still worked at his trade in
      town, but he could go home before dark; and, anyway, he wasn&#8217;t
      afraid of Erickson&#8217;s ghost&#8212;nor panthers. More about Erickson&#8217;s
      ghost and the panthers, later. My work kept me in the store until 10 o&#8217;clock,
      at night. After marrying, Alfred Hazeltine built a home in town, the house
      now owned by Adam Ingalls. And later he bought the Charley Hazeltine
      120-acres adjoining his farm, and moved back to the country. His brother
      Charley and family went to Payette, Idaho. Alfred Hazeltine was a fine
      man. He was deacon in the Baptist Church. One time when a protracted
      meeting was in progress, he said to me, &#8220;By-damn, You, you ought to
      join the Church.&#8221;</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">Andrew J. Maxwell, with his wife Lizzie and two
      children, Demmy and May, and, at this time, the estranged wife of Elisha
      Maxwell, lived on a homestead adjoining town-and, like the Isaacsons and
      Andersons and Alfred Hazeltine, were regarded as town folk. Elisha
      Maxwell, brother of Andy, lived part time with his mother in town, as did
      also his wife. Elisha&#8217;s wife was the daughter of Matt Randall, then
      living near Ontario, seven miles south-west of Wetmore. There was much in
      common between the town folk and those borderites. Let it be a picnic or a
      dog-fight they were all on hand. Altogether they made one big-shall I say&#8212;happy
      family. This, however, strictly speaking, would not be quite right. Gus
      Mayer built the first residence in Wetmore&#8212;the Neville dwelling on
      the corner where the First National Bank now stands. His daughter Lillie
      (Mrs. Peter Cassity) was the first child born in the town&#8212;though
      Irving Isaacson was born earlier in a temporary shack near the present
      depot before the town was established.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">There was a one-room school house on the site of the
      present City hall, with one teacher, John Burr&#8212;in 1869. I was nearly
      eight years old then, and my brother Charley was a little over nine. This
      was to be our first&#8212;and last</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">school. Charley died at the age of eighteen; and I was out

      <span class="c0">While our home was being built in Wetmore on the lot
      where Hart&#8217;s locker is now, the family found shelter in a one-room,
      up-and-down rough pine board shanty in hollow west of the graveyard, on
      the Andy Maxwell homestead&#8212;the farm now owned and occupied by
      Orville Bryant. This little &#8220;cubbyhole&#8221; was originally built
      to house Andy</span> <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c0">s brother

      class="c0">about a half mile</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">to
      the school house. And during that first winter, after the path had been
      obliterated by a big snow which drifted and packed solidly over the board
      fence enclosing the school grounds, bearing up pupils</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">even horses and sleighs zoomed over the drifted in
      fence&#8212;we skimmed over the white in a direct air line to the school,
      with not a thing in the way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>

      <span class="c0">Our parents were from the deep South, and on the farm
      Charley and I had no playmates other than our younger brothers, Sam, Dave,
      and Nick&#8212;even the hired hand on the Wolfley Creek farm, Ben Summers,
      was a Tennessean</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">hence we
      brought into a school already seven-ways-to-the-bad, in language, just one
      more type of bad English.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Many of the other pupils were children of immigrants</span>

      Wales, and the three Scandinavian countries</span> <span>&#8212;</span>

      own. In those days we learned from our associates rather than from books&#8212;that
      is, unconsciously became imitators&#8212;and the result, in most cases,
      was not promising. My mentor was a Swede girl several years my senior.
      &#8220;Tilda&#8221; Isaacson was neat, sweet, and sincerity compounded.
      She would tell me, &#8220;You youst don&#8217;t say it that way here, my
      leetle Yonnie.&#8221; This, of course, was the first runoff. In time, our
      Wetmore school was to rank with the best. And for all I know maybe it did
      then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The old Wetmore school made history</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">history of a kind. An incident of those eventful years
      having decidedly bad-English flavor occurred after John Burr had been
      succeeded by D. B. Mercer, who came to us from a homestead up in the Abbey
      neighborhood between here and Seneca. Mercer gave one of his pupils a
      well-earned whipping one forenoon. At the noon hour, the boy&#8217;s older
      brother danced up and down the aisle in the school-room, singing, &#8220;Goodie,
      goodie, popper&#8217;s goin&#8217; to lick the teacher.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That dancing boy was Clifford Ashton.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Soon after school had taken up in the afternoon, Mr.
      Ashton, late of London, walked in unannounced. He was moderately docile in
      presenting his grievance and the teacher, not to be outdone by this green
      Englishman, treated his caller civilly. The trouble seemed to be amicably
      settled. But the teacher&#8217;s mild manner had emboldened the
      Englishman. As a parting stab, in an acrimonious monotone without stopping
      for breath or punctuation, Ashton delivered the ultimatum: &#8220;But if
      you ever w&#8217;ip one of my children again sir I shall surely</span>
      <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c2 c0">ave to w&#8217;ip you.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">This was a mistake</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">a real &#8220;John Bull&#8221; blunder, Mercer was a large,
      muscular man. With a single pass he knocked the Englishman cold right
      there in the school room. Ashton fell almost at my feet. When he had come
      up out</span> <span>o</span> <span class="c2 c0">f his stupor, still
      blinking and grimacing, Ashton bellowed, &#8220;I shall see a solicitor
      about this!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;See him and bedamned,&#8221; bawled Mercer.
      &#8220;Now get out!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After he had become seasoned, Ashton was really a fine
      fellow, rather above the average of his countrymen in intelligence. And he
      reared a fine family of boys and girls</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">Clifford, Anna, Eva, Stanley, Horace, and Vincent. Ashton
      was a carpenter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At another time, James Neville rushed unceremoniously</span>
      <span>i</span><span class="c2 c0">nto the schoolroom and hurled a big rock
      at Mercer&#8217;s head, barely missing. The rock tore a big hole in the
      blackboard back of the teacher. Neville was a powerful man. Just what the
      grievance was, and how a lively fight was averted, has slipped my memory&#8212;though
      I rather suspect Neville did not tarry long after he had failed to make a
      hit with the rock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">These two infractions, and many more, passed as being
      only by-plays incidental to a good school, as interpreted by those
      pristine patrons.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Andy Maxwell&#8217;s home was on the hill west of the
      shack. But Andy did not live there long after we came&#8212;in fact, he
      was off the place for keeps even before our house in town was ready for
      occupancy. Mary Massey, unmarried sister of Mrs. Maxwell, as well as the
      estranged wife of Elisha Maxwell, was at this time in the home&#8212;altogether
      too many Women to be in one man&#8217;s home. Mary, a close observer, had
      said she&#8217;d see a man of her&#8217;s and that other woman both in h</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">l before she&#8217;d play second
      fiddle in her own home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Second fiddle&#8221; in this sense was of
      course a figurative term having dire implications. Then, too, Lou
      Hazeltine, a sister-in-law by reason of a first marriage with a brother of
      the Massey sisters, had her say. It was critical.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It occurs to me that I have seen in print a recent
      version of an old quotation or saying, often expressed then, which, in
      line with Mary&#8217;s blow-off, defined the situation admirably. It read:
      &#8220;Hell hath no music like a woman playing second fiddle.&#8221; For
      the text of the original quotation, ask any oldtimer&#8212;or you may
      substitute &#8220;fury&#8221; for music, and &#8220;scorned&#8221; for
      playing second fiddle, and you will have it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">These facts were gleaned while spending the day with
      my mother in Lou Hazeltine&#8217;s home. Lou had said to my mother, as was
      customary at the time, &#8220;Bring the children and stay all day.&#8221;
      So we were duly scrubbed and dressed up for the occasion. I think Lou
      wanted to unburden herself. But how she could have thought the children
      would be interested in such topic of conversation is beyond me. True,
      there was her daughter Lizzie Massey, about my age, for company&#8212;but
      Lizzie behaved as though she thought she might miss something, and paid no
      attention to her mother&#8217;s frequent admonitions, &#8220;You children
      run along outside and play.&#8221; I think Lou was unduly worked-up over
      the matter. She would look at us children, and then put her hand up to the
      side of her mouth, come down momentarily off her &#8220;high-horse&#8221;
      almost to a whisper, and channel the choice bits to mother. I think my
      mother would have been satisfied with less than was said&#8212;and
      certainly, as a newcomer in town, she did not want to be the one to spread
      gossip. However, she repeated it all, with apparent relish, to my father,
      adopting Lou&#8217;s adept manner of, shielding it from the children with
      her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Massey women decided that Andy&#8217;s sympathies
      for his estranged sister-in-law were simply &#8220;outlandish&#8221;&#8212;and
      Mrs. Andy invoked the law on him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Constable Lon Huff started to take him to Seneca, but
      when they came to the creek crossing, a ford, in my Uncle Nick Bristow&#8217;s
      timber, Andy slipped off his shackled boots, jumped out of the buggy and
      made his getaway, barefooted, over the snow-covered ground. My cousin,
      Burrel Bristow, followed Andy&#8217;s barefoot tracks through the woods
      and counted the trees barked by the constable&#8217;s gun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That Alonzo&#8212;he was the shrewd one. Shot up the
      trees, he did&#8212;and brought home Andy&#8217;s shackled boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I liked Andy&#8212;and, though I was never to see him
      again,</span> <span>as</span> <span class="c2 c0">glad that he had gotten
      away from the constable. I think that nearly all the other people here
      were glad it, too. And, moreover, I&#8217;ll bet Andy did not travel far
      without foot-protection.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">You may be sure Andy did not come home to his wife.
      Lou Hazeltine told my mother that the arrest was big mistake. Charley
      Hazeltine, Lou&#8217;s Swede husband, said &#8220;The vimens was yust
      yumpin at collusions.&#8221; Elisha&#8217;s wife and Andy&#8217;s daughter
      May left Wetmore soon thereafter. Demmy remained here with his grandmother
      for several years&#8212;then went to his father at Spearfish, South
      Dakota, from which place Andy was then operating a stage line to Deadwood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With Ursula Maxwell and Charley Hazeltine as
      long-range intermediaries, Andy Maxwell waived claim to farm equipment,
      livestock, and all other belongings, in favor of Lizzie Maxwell. All Andy
      asked&#8212;and received&#8212;were his children, and the promise of no
      contest in two divorces, Lizzie Massey Maxwell remained here. She sold the
      farm improvements to Dr. W. F. Troughton for $50. Troughton filed on the
      homestead in 1872.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the meantime Andy, with his daughter May and Mrs.
      Elisha, traveling out of Miles City, Montana, in covered wagons, with four
      other men, were attacked by Sioux and Nez Perce Indians&#8212;the siege
      lasting for three days. The newspapers said at the time, it was the
      hardest-fought Indian battle of all times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">A three-column account of that Indian attack, written
      reminiscently by a correspondent of the Chicago Times seventeen years
      after it had taken place, found its way by mere chance into the Wetmore
      Spectator&#8212;right back to the old home of the defenders</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">through the medium of the Western Newspaper Union,
      Kansas City, Mo., from which auxiliary the Spectator then got its inside
      pages ready-printed. It was a hair-raising story&#8212;one that could be
      read with interest again and again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Incidentally, Andy Maxwell had Indian blood in his own
      veins. His mother told me she was a quarter-breed. She had Indian
      features.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then there was another Indian story having Wetmore
      connections. I have in my newspaper files Catherine German-Swerdfeger&#8217;s
      own story</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">nearly a full page
      written for the Spectator</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">of
      the slaying by the Indians of her father and mother, a brother and two
      sisters; and the capture of herself and three sisters&#8212;Sophie, Julia,
      and Addie. John German, from Blue Ridge, Georgia, with his family, was
      traveling by ox-team and covered wagon, through Kansas on the way to
      Colorado at the time of the attack.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Catherine&#8217;s description of the abandonment of
      her two little sisters, aged five and six, after two weeks on the move by
      the roving band of Indians, on the then uninhabited plains somewhere
      between southwestern Kansas and the main Cheyenne camp in Texas, in the
      midst of a big herd of buffalo, where, after following on foot until well
      nigh exhausted, as mounted Indians forced the two older girls on ponies
      away from the scene, the little girls lived&#8212;no, existed&#8212;for
      six weeks, in October and November weather, with no shelter other than a
      clay bank, on the leavings of soldiers, (cracker crumbs, scattered grains
      of corn, and hackberries), in a deserted camp, by a creek, would wring
      your heart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Catherine&#8217;s personal explanation to me was that
      the little girls, when down to the last morsel of edible scrapings, had
      difficulty in deciding which one should eat it. The little one thought the
      older one should have it&#8212;that it might enable her to live to get
      away. It would appear that the little one had already resigned herself to
      her fate. The older one decided it rightly belonged to the baby. And
      neither of them ate it. It was only a dirty kernel of corn, Catherine said
      in her article: &#8220;God had a hand in that work, and I believe you will
      agree with me when I say He wrought a miracle.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And I, for one, certainly do agree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Several inaccurate accounts of the fate of this
      unfortunate family have been written&#8212;one by a professor, who
      evidently did not have the full facts, as text for the Wichita schools.
      And another one, as told to a reporter for the Kansas City Journal by
      &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Jimmy Cannon, an interpreter on Government pay-rolls,
      stationed in Kansas (the rider of &#8220;Little Gray Johnny&#8221;) in
      which he himself, in a daring dash on a band of Indians, rescued one of
      the little girls</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">which, in
      fact, he didn&#8217;t do at all, according to Catherine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Actually, it was this story of &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s
      that caused Catherine to write the true story of the massacre and of their
      captivity, for my paper. Catherine said it was soldiers under Lieutenant
      Baldwin of the Fifth Infantry who found her little sisters, sick,
      emaciated, on the</span> <span>verge of starvation</span><span class="c0">,
      in that same deserted camp, which was really no camp at all&#8212;only an
      overnight camp site. And though soldiers were constantly on the trail of
      the Indians, there was no spectacular dash by the military in the rescue
      the two older girls. When first taken into the main Cheyenne camp, in
      Texas, Chief Stonecalf told Catherine, who was then nearly eighteen years
      old, that he was grieved know that his people would do such a deed; that
      he would, Soon as possible, deliver them to the Cheyenne and Arapahoe
      Agency&#8212;and that he did. Catherine had much</span> <span>praise</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">for Chief Stonecalf, and General Nelson A. Miles,
      their efforts in liberating them. Under Indian custom, girls were regarded
      as loot, and had to be bought from their captors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Jim Smith, now living in the west part of Wetmore, went
      to school</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">at the Porter
      school house on Wolfley-creek&#8212;with the two younger German girls. Pat
      Corney, living on a farm adjacent to the J. P. Smith farm, was guardian of
      the girls.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Addie&#8212;Mrs. Frank Andrews&#8212;is still living,
      or was a few years ago, at Berwick in Nemaha county. A few years back,
      Mrs. Andrews was invited to appear on a radio program in New York, with
      all expenses paid&#8212;but she did not go. Amos Swerdfeger, husband of
      Catherine&#8212;and son of Adam Swerdfeger, who was among the first
      settlers here&#8212;died at Atascadero, California, Nov. 12, 1921, age 73.
      Catherine died in 1932, age 75.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">These two Indian stories would make good reading now&#8212;and
      while they are in line with my endeavor to give a true picture of the old
      days, they are not included in this volume. Nothing but my own writings,
      since my retirement from the newspaper field appears in this book.
      However, slight reference to those two Indian attacks were made in my more
      recently published stories, which are reproduced in this book&#8212;just
      as they were written at the time. Many changes have taken place in the
      meantime.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After it became generally known here that the
      defenders of that fiercely fought Indian battle in Montana were former
      Wetmore citizens, many of our people came in from time to time to read the
      story. That page of the old files is pretty well thumbed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">About fifty years ago, a family by the name of
      Cummings came here and lived for a short while in the northwest part of
      town. Mrs. Cummings said she was the daughter of Andy Maxwell. I did not
      learn her given name, but supposed she was May. She called at the
      Spectator office, and read the story.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, in February, 1939, Mrs. Nettie E. Rachford,
      Westwood, California, wrote the Spectator asking for a copy of the story,
      saying she was the daughter of Andy Maxwell. I then copied the story from
      my files, and W. F. Turrentine printed it again in the Spectator, February
      1939.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This reprint of the Maxwell story caused Dr. LeVere
      Anderson, born and reared on a farm five miles southwest of Wetmore&#8212;now
      established in Miles City, Montana&#8212;to bring the matter of that
      Indian fight to the attention of the Miles City Chamber of Commerce. The
      Chamber was at that very time sponsoring a homecoming jubilee&#8212;and
      after an exchange of letters between Miles City and Wetmore, Andy Maxwell,
      then living in Santa Ana, California, was invited to be the Chamber&#8217;s
      honored guest&#8212;but he was unable to make the trip. Andy Maxwell died
      at Santa Ana in 1941, at the age of ninety-nine.</span>

      <span class="c9 c0">Our New Temporary Home</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Earlier in this writing I mentioned the fact that our
      family had three years on the Hazeltine farm. My older brother, Charley,
      contracted &#8220;quick consumption.&#8221; There was a prevailing notion
      that the scent of new pine lumber and fresh country air would be helpful
      in effecting a cure. So my father made a contract with Charley Hazeltine
      for the erection of a new house under the cottonwoods on the hill near the
      old log-house which had been the home of father of the Hazeltine brothers&#8212;with
      a three-year lease on 40 acres of farm land.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The new house had plenty of exposed pine lumber and
      fresh air all right. It was a box-house made of barn-boards, unplastered,
      with sleeping quarters in the loft, comparable to the hay-mow in a barn,
      reached by a ladder from one corner of the ground-floor room. On
      occasions, snow sifted through the cracks in the loft, covering my bed
      completely. The lower room was more closely built, which was living room,
      kitchen, and sleeping quarters for my parents&#8212;and the babies. There
      was a standard sized bed, and a trundle bed&#8212;the latter shoved under
      the regular bed in the daytime, and pulled out to the middle of the room
      at night. It was a replica of many another home of that day, only the
      others could have added protection of plastered walls. Then too, it was
      Dr. Thomas Milam&#8217;s belief that Charley would show improvement in the
      new home with the coming of spring. But, come time for the swelling of the
      buds of those old cottonwoods in the spring of 1879, the &#8220;Grim
      Reaper&#8221; beat the carpenters to the finish. Charley had died before
      the new house was ready for occupancy. And that made long lonesome hours
      for me on the farm. Charley had an enviable record as an exemplary boy&#8212;and,
      try as I might, I have not been able to follow wholly in his foot-steps.
      But I am sure that my memory of him has helped to make me what I am.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">The fame of my Rose Garden has traveled far&#8212;to
      California and to Florida. Proof: The two little girls of Shady Mitchell,
      a Tennessean, who conducted a general store in Wetmore some years back and
      lived across the street west from the school grounds in the house now
      owned and occupied by Prof. Howard V. Bixby&#8212;in their school work at
      their new home in Orlando, Florida, wrote in collaboration a theme,
      beginning: &#8220;There was a man living in our town in Kansas who grew
      roses just to give them away to his friends&#8212;&#8221; This is the
      extent of the essay which has been relayed to me&#8212;but I&#8217;ve no
      doubt that Verda Bess and Marjorie Lou acknowledged having been the
      recipient of roses from my garden. I don&#8217;t think I ever permitted a
      little girl&#8212;nor a big one either, for that matter&#8212;who stopped
      by to admire my roses, to go away without a bouquet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And particularly have I been pleased to supply the
      girl graduates of our splendid Wetmore High School at Commencement time.
      Last year&#8212;spring of 1947&#8212;the garden did not show promise of
      early bloom of quality flowers, and I got the girl graduates some
      beautiful long-stemmed &#8220;Better Times&#8221; red roses, ($7.85 per
      doz.), from Rock&#8217;s in Kansas City. I planned to make this an annual
      contribution, whether at home or away, as a sort of commemoration of the
      fine Rose Garden I once owned. The garden is now owned by Raymond and
      Marjorie McDaniel.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Before leaving in the fall for California, I told the
      girls I would send them roses by air mail&#8212;but, through an oversight
      of someone, I was not apprised of the date of the 1948 Commencement. And
      this was one time when the girls, through no fault of their own, (except
      possibly trusting another than a member of the class to do the notifying),
      missed getting some really high-class graduation roses&#8212;roses grow to
      perfection in California&#8212;which I think was more of a disappointment
      to me than perhaps to anyone else, unless it should have been my niece,
      Alice Bristow-Tavares, who was to have supplied two dozen extremely
      beautiful long-stemmed Etoile de Hollande red roses from her climbers. A
      Fresno florist had been engaged to pack them for mailing.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Having bought little three-year-old Karen McDaniel a
      5-cent cone, and also one for her to take home to her little brother
      Harry, I laid a couple of nickels on the counter at the restaurant; and
      then put down a dime, and picked up the two nickels&#8212;this
      twenty-cents representing the sum total of my cash as of the moment. Karen
      said, &#8220;What you do that for?&#8221; I told her that I was going to
      purchase a 5-cent lead-pencil from Charley Shaffer at the drug store, and
      that I wanted to keep the nickels, as it would save time of waiting to get
      back the nickel in change, were I to keep the dime. She said, brightly,
      &#8220;He might not have a nickel.&#8221; I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s just
      it.&#8221; Not realizing the risk which I myself was cooking up at the
      moment, I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s never wise to take a risk when it can
      just as easily be avoided.&#8221; Placing the two nickels beside the
      little dime, I told her the dime was worth as much as the two bigger
      nickels. Thinking to see if she had caught on, I said, (rather badly
      stated), &#8220;Now, what you think&#8212;which would you rather have?&#8221;
      She smiled, almost saucily grinned, and reaching for the dime, said,
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the little one&#8212;you want to keep the big ones.&#8221;</span>

      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was a lazy October afternoon. The woods were still
      in full leaf and the tops of the trees, touched by early frost, had turned
      to reddish brown and golden yellow. It was a fine day for squirrel
      hunting. But this is not strictly a hunting story.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">There were six in the party&#8212;three men of widely
      varying ages and, as the college youth would say, three skirts</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but, for convenience, all wore
      trousers that afternoon. It was a sort of boarding-house party out for
      recreation and game. They were: Mrs. Edna Weaver, Miss Genevieve Weaver,
      Miss Thelma Sullivan, Milton Mayer, Raymond Weaver and the writer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our wanderings carried us into the heavily wooded
      section near the head of Wolfley creek. I had no hunter&#8217;s license
      and, being a law-loving citizen, carried no gun. The hunters, alert for
      game, went deep into the woods. And I trailed along, not noticing, not
      caring, where we were going. Having passed the stage of life when one
      normally gives a whoop where he is or what he does, to me, one place was
      as good as another.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And then, of a sudden, I became tremendously alert. We
      were now coming near to my father&#8217;s old farm&#8212;the home he had
      blazed out of the wilderness, so to speak, on first coming to Kansas&#8212;oh,
      so many years ago. That farm is now owned by Mrs. Worley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A few of the many letters commenting on my published
      stories are printed in this volume&#8212;in all cases, blocked in the
      story to which the letter refers. They help to attest the authenticity and
      worthiness of the article. It&#8217;s most stimulating to have one&#8217;s
      friends write in and say, &#8220;I know that to be true.&#8221; It&#8217;s
      like the &#8220;Amen&#8221; to a fervent prayer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The regret is that so few of the old ones are left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">For sentimental reasons I wanted to hunt that old place</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">to live, briefly, again the days
      of my youth. As we came to the line fence between the Worley farm and the
      Brock pasture lands on the east, my companions balked at wire&#8212;wanted
      to turn back. My suggestion that we go on was regarded as &#8220;idiotic.&#8221;
      The Worley timber was un-inviting. There were lots of weeds over on that
      side, and probably snakes, too. I know rattlesnakes infested that place
      when I lived there as a boy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I climbed over the fence, anyway, and was soon racing
      toward a mammoth elm tree&#8212;a tree that had budded and leaves more
      than sixty times since the day I last saw that place. The hunters came
      over on the bound. &#8220;It went up this tree,&#8221; I lied. There was
      no squirrel. I was in truth a boy again&#8212;a very small boy&#8212;resorting
      to childish subterfuges.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But my &#8220;idiotic&#8221; idea wasn&#8217;t so bad.
      The hunters a got a nice bag of squirrels on that side of the fence and in
      passing the spot again an hour later one of party thought she saw my
      mythical squirrel go into a hole in one of the top-most branches of that
      old monarch of the woods. So that was that. Kindly forget the ethics
      involved. We hunted the timber the full length of that place Dad&#8217;s
      old farm. Now there were big trees&#8212;and some tall trees. As I
      remember, there were big tall trees on that place when we lived there more
      than a half century ago. My father split rails from that timber to fence
      the farm, And as ex-woodsman he was he was inordinately proud of that rail
      fence, of his excellent craftsmanship. In his native state, with the
      straight-splitting birch and poplars, it would have been a simple matter.
      Here it was an accomplishment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In that day there were two kinds of rail fences in
      general use. The &#8220;leaner&#8221; fence was constructed with posts set
      on top the ground in a leaning position and supported by stakes on the
      under side, with the rails nailed onto the posts. The &#8220;stake and
      rider&#8221; fence, also sometimes called the &#8220;worm&#8221; fence,
      was made by laying the end of one rail on top of another, in zigzag
      fashion, at an angle of about twenty-five degrees, so that the ends would
      lap, with a ground chunk under each section, and when built up to the
      desired height</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">usually
      seven rails&#8212;two cross-stakes were set in the ground at the junction
      of the panels, with another rail on top the cross-stake. My father&#8217;s
      fence was of the latter type. It took a lot of rails.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also I recall seeing my father shoot a squirrel out of
      the top of a very tall tree with his Colt&#8217;s revolver. That
      six-shooter was presented to him by Federal officers during the Civil War
      for protecting himself against a band of guerrillas. More about the
      guerrillas later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And on this October day I saw the spot where the old
      house stood on the south flank of that woodland&#8212;the house around
      which I played with my brothers as a care-free child, and where my mother
      almost cried her heart out because of loneliness. Also, it was here where
      my mother told me a story one day&#8212;a story of my father, of herself,
      of why we had left our home in the Southland. Our tears mingled over the
      telling of that story then. And there was sadness in my heart that October
      afternoon as I paused, reverently, for a moment in passing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Although I was born in the sunny South where magnolias
      bloom and mockingbirds sing all winter long, my first vivid recollection
      of life was upon this bleak Kansas farm, hot and wind-swept in summer,
      cold and desolate in winter. The rigid climate of this new plains country
      home was in such marked contrast to the mild and even temperature of my
      mother&#8217;s native heavily timbered state as to her long to go back to
      her old home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was eight wilderness miles to Powhattan, the
      post-office; five miles to Granada, the trading post; and one mile to the
      nearest neighbors&#8212;Rube and Anne Wolfley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The mill that made our sorghum molasses&#8212;nearly
      every farmer grew a patch of cane for making molasses to go with
      corn-bread, the staple diet&#8212;one mile off from Powhattan, was owned
      by Charley Smith, the same Charley Smith who had in earlier days, been
      keeper of a station (his home ) on the old John Brown &#8220;underground
      railroad,&#8221; where runaway Negro slaves, being transported to Canada,
      were in hiding through the day. I know it was the Charley Smith place, for
      Ben Summers, our hired man, said it still smelled of &#8220;niggers.&#8221;
      But of course it didn&#8217;t. That was Ben</span> <span>&#8217;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">s way of opening a sizeable tale about Mr. Brown and
      his underground railroad.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And I wouldn&#8217;t know how far it was to the mill that
      ground our corn-meal, but I do know there was one&#8212;for we had no
      bread other than cornbread for months on end. Only on rare occasions would
      we have &#8220;lightbread&#8221;&#8212;made of wheat flower, of course.
      The cornbread my mother usually made was not the cornpone customary in the
      South. Cracklin</span> <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c2 c0">bread and
      seasoned cornbread was much better&#8212;that is, for most palates. I wish
      I could have some of it now. But there was one traveling salesman, Hugh
      Graham, who preferred the cornpone. He would wire the hotel here of his
      expected arrival, which meant that for breakfast, dinner, or supper, he
      wanted cornpone. I think the cornpone was made of cornmeal, salt, and
      water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I recall that Ben Summers had gone &#8220;acourtin&#8221;
      Betsy Porter that evening, when my parents were shelling corn, by
      candle-light, on a sheet spread upon the kitchen floor, to take to the
      mill&#8212;probably the Reiderer mill east of Holton</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">when a big bullsnake which had crept in through a
      displaced chink in the log house, slithered across the sheet, gliding over
      the corn, and out an open door. The matter was debated, seriously&#8212;then
      it was decided the hogs should have that corn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father and mother, with their three small children,
      came to Kansas from Nashville, Tennessee, in 1865. They came by steamboat
      on the Cumberland, the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to Atchison. The
      family was met there by my uncle Nick, father&#8217;s only brother, with
      an ox-team, taking most of two days to drive us to his home on Wolfley
      creek. That farm is now owned by William Mast.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the way out from Atchison, as we were nearing home,
      we ran into one of those fierce prairie fires that so often menaced life
      and property of the early settlers. I was very young then and cannot say
      positively that what I am about to relate here is from actual memory,
      although I have always believed that I retained a mental picture of that
      prairie fire. Details are now a bit hazy&#8212;and, you know, with the
      very young there is always a borderland not any too well defined between
      what you may have actually seen and what you may have heard others
      recount.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Anyway, there was a prairie fire. And its sinister red
      flames&#8212;a long snake-like line of crackling, blazing hell</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">overhung with an ominous pall of
      thick black smoke, sent a spasm of fear surging through my uncle and my
      parents.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">That prairie fire was on one of the big creek bottoms</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">probably on the old Overland Trail</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">somewhere between Granada and
      Wetmore, only there was no Wetmore then. We had just forded a stream and
      were well out in a big bottom where the slough grass was as tall as the
      oxen, when the fire was sighted coming over the hills towards us, and
      fanned by a brisk wind it was traveling at terrific speed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My uncle, who was driving, ran up along side his oxen
      and yelled, &#8220;Whoa-haw-Buck! Jerry!&#8221; The oxen seemed to sense
      danger and the wagon was turned around in no time. Just then a man on
      horseback came running up. Without stopping to say a word the man jumped
      off his horse and touched a lighted match to the tall dead grass in front
      of the outfit. An effort was made by the man to beat out the fire on the
      windward side. The man then excitedly commanded my uncle to drive across
      the thin line of back-fire into the newly burned space. It looked like the
      rider had come out of that blazing inferno especially to warn us. And as
      the wagon moved away he yelled loudly so as to be heard above the roar of
      the encroaching flames from behind, &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, man,
      follow it up as fast as you can.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That young man was Fred Liebig.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Boyhood impressions stick like the bark on a tree,
      while later events are submerged in the whirlpool of life and are
      forgotten. One of the outstanding incidents of my young life took place
      upon this Wolfley creek farm. I remember it as distinctly as if it
      occurred only yesterday. It was my first&#8212;and last&#8212;alcoholic
      debauch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I have already told you that rattlesnakes infested that
      place way back in the distant past. One of them&#8212;a fat, seven-button
      specimen&#8212;took a whack at me one summer day, its fangs loaded with
      deadly green fluid sinking deep the top of my right foot. It was August</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">dogdays</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and of course I was barefoot. The children of pioneer
      settlers didn</span> <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c2 c0">t wear
      shoes, except in cold weather, even when their fathers were excellent
      shoemakers, a distinction my father enjoyed at that time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My father was over at Granada. A neighbor was sent after
      him</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and for whiskey, the
      then universal remedy for snakebite. Finding no whiskey at Granada, the
      courier, on horseback, came on to Wetmore, which town was just starting
      then, and failing again, pushed on the Seneca, stopping on the way long
      enough to change horses. The round trip approximately sixty miles and
      eight hours had elapsed when the rider returned with whiskey. He brought a
      generous supply.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In the meantime my mother had dumped a package of baking
      soda into a basin of warm water. She bade me put my foot in it</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and two little fountains of green
      came oozing up through the soda-whitened water. And she gave me tea made
      from yard plantain&#8212;why, I wouldn&#8217;t know.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also my Uncle Nick had arrived by the time the rider
      returned with the whisky. I didn&#8217;t like the taste of the nasty stuff
      and, boy-like, set up a howl about having to drink it. And my Uncle,
      desirous of helping in every possible way, said, soothingly, &#8220;Johnny,
      take a little, and Uncle take a little.&#8221; We both passed out about
      the same time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I don&#8217;t mean to infer by this that my Uncle was
      a drunkard. He was not. And, mind you, he grew up in a country at a time
      when you could buy good old Bourbon at any crossroads grocery store as you
      would buy a jug of vinegar&#8212;and almost as cheaply.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My Uncle Nick was a soldier in the Mexican war of
      1848. And he was a soldier in the Civil war&#8212;an adventurer, and in a
      way a &#8220;soldier of fortune.&#8221; He prospected for gold, and hunted
      mountain lions&#8212;with the long rifle&#8212;in the Rockies, just as he
      and my father had hunted panthers in Tennessee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This ferocious beast, if you don&#8217;t know, is the
      big cat with four names. In the South and East&#8212;extinct in most
      sections now&#8212;he is the dreaded panther. In the Rockies he is the
      mountain lion. Farther west, in Arizona and the Sierras, he is the cougar.
      Somewhere he is called the puma. And everywhere he is &#8220;the killer.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Two strangers stopped at our home just after I had
      passed out&#8212;that is, after I had become limp, unable to stand, unable
      to talk, from the effects of the whisky. But I could understand as well as
      ever what was said. One of the men suggested that if they could find the
      snake and cut it open and bind the parts to my foot that it would draw the
      poison out. I knew that Jim Barnes had killed that snake, and the stranger&#8217;s
      suggestion gave me a mental spasm. I could not speak out and tell&#8217;
      them that I had had about all of that snake that I could stand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The earthquake of 1868</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">or thereabout</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">greatly
      frightened my mother. It was her first experience with quakes. And,
      woman-like, with a perpetual grudge against the erratic Kansas weather
      changes, she laid this shakeup in climate, which, it seemed, she never
      could become accustomed to. And when the house trembled and the dishes
      cupboard began to rattle, she rushed out into the yard, where my father
      and the children were, and said, &#8220;If we must all go to the devil I
      would just as soon walk as ride.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also Indians from the Kickapoo reservation, while
      harmless enough at the time, had a habit of prowling about over the
      country, and a band of them nearly scared the wits out of my mother one
      hot summer day. She saw the blanketed red skins, on ponies, coming down
      the road, single-file. Gathering her youngsters, much as a hen gathers her
      brood the approach of danger&#8212;and much as my mother had once before
      taken her children under her protecting arms and saved their lives, as you
      shall see presently&#8212;she hid in the cornfield until the rovers had
      left our farm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now another prairie fire. If there could be any
      question about the youngster having retained with photographic accuracy
      the horrors of the one earlier mentioned, there can be no doubt about this
      later one, which, whipped by the ever-present wind, stole in upon us in
      the night, My father&#8217;s much prized rail fence was laid low, and only
      by heroic efforts was the house saved. These dreaded prairie fires and
      other subjected frights incident to the new country seemed to place a mark
      upon my mother.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;William,&#8221; she said one day to my father,
      &#8220;we might as well have remained in Tennessee and taken our chances
      on being killed by guerillas as to come all the way out to this
      God-for-saken country only to be burned to death by prairie fires, or
      shaken to pieces by earthquakes, or frightened to death by Indians.&#8221;
      And I am sure that if the Kansas cyclone had then enjoyed the widespread
      reputation that it does in this year of grace, my mother would have
      included that also.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In Tennessee, my father was a shoemaker and tanner by
      trade. And, by the grace of a kind Providence&#8212;and some quick
      shooting&#8212;he was a live Union &#8220;sympathizer&#8221; in a Rebel
      stronghold. The great conflict&#8212;the Civil War&#8212;between the North
      and the South was then on. My father had not, at this time, joined the
      fighting forces on either side. He was content to ply his trade, make
      leather and shoes, both of which were very much needed at the time. But my
      father made the almost fatal mistake of &#8220;exercising his rights as a
      free-born citizen,&#8221; in having his say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The South was not quite solid for Confederacy.
      Sometimes even families were divided. In my mother&#8217;s family two of
      her brothers favored the North and two were for the South&#8212;&#8221;rank
      rebels,&#8221; my mother said. None of them went to war. They worked in a
      powder mill&#8212;more dangerous, by far. Twice the mill blew up, and each
      time one of my Uncles was blown into fragments. Also one of my mother&#8217;s
      acquired relatives hid in a cave for the duration of the war.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The guerilla element was composed of Southerners, not in
      colors</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">and they made life
      miserable for any</span> <span>o</span> <span class="c2 c0">ne who dared
      to express an opinion, on the aspects of the war, contrary to their views.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The hush of a November night lay upon the forest, in
      the thick of which was located my father&#8217;s home, his tan-yard, his
      shoeshop. The night&#8217;s stillness was broken by a volley of bullets
      from the guerilla guns crashing through the windows and doors of the log
      house.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My mother&#8212;herself only a girl in her teens&#8212;took
      her two babies and crept under the bed, which, luckily, had been moved to
      another part of the house that very day. And that shift of the bed saved
      the family from the death-dealing bullets poured into the house with that
      first onslaught.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My father had only a muzzle-loading, double-barrel
      shotgun, with two charges in the gun&#8212;and no more ammunition</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">with which to defend himself and
      his little family against that mob of armed men. The main body of
      guerillas, on horseback, were in the front yard. The house stood upon the
      bank of a deep gully, with little or no backyard. A wide plank served as a
      walk across the gully. Beyond that was heavy timber.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Believing that his family would be safer with him out
      of the house, my father, only partly dressed, grabbed his shotgun and
      flung open the back door. He quickly emptied both barrels of his gun into
      the two men who were guarding the back door. The revolver in the hands of
      the first man in line, standing on the plank, was being brought down on
      him when the charge from father&#8217;s shotgun cut off the crook of the
      man&#8217;s arm at the elbow and entered his body, killing him instantly.
      The bullet from the guerilla&#8217;s revolver plowed through my father&#8217;s
      hat. And that was the revolver my father shot squirrels with in Kansas. It
      was retrieved by Federal soldiers and presented to him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The other man was mortally wounded and lay there in
      yard, at the far end of the plank walk, until morning, Things had happened
      so quickly, and so disastrously to their ranks, that the mob believed the
      house was occupied by armed men. And, after firing another volley into the
      home, many of the bullets this time penetrating the bed under which my
      mother, with her babies, lay flat on the floor, the mob withdrew to a safe
      distance&#8212;but sentinels were kept posted in the nearby woods until
      morning. All told, more than one hundred shots were fired into the house.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now a man from the outside dashed in at the back
      -the door by which father had made his exit. Hurriedly he bolted the door
      from within.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My mother, peering out from her hiding place under
      bed, exclaimed in surprise, &#8220;You here, Sandy! What does this mean?&#8221;
      And before he could explain, she cried, &#8220;Oh, I smell smoke. Is the
      house on fire, Sandy?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said&#8212;&#8221;it was. And
      the tanyard buildings and shoeshop are now burning.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sandy Fouse, a Southern boy, had worked for my father
      in his tobacco fields, and lived at our home. My father grew tobacco on
      the side. I was told Sandy took a marked interest in me&#8212;a baby. God
      only knows why it was so, but it seems I was destined to become the
      favorite of the family. I had an older brother, too. But it seems I was
      the favorite of my Aunt Harriet who helped my mother, and the pet of Sandy
      who &#8220;wormed&#8221; the tobacco.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And as with the prairie fire&#8212;only with positive
      conviction this time&#8212;I must again rely on what has been told me.
      Reaching under the bed and hauling me out, Sandy said, &#8220;Why, I&#8217;d
      risk my life any time for this here boy Johnny&#8212;or any of you-all.&#8221;
      And that was just what he was doing that night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">When the mob had withdrawn after starting a fire against
      the house, Sandy ran back and kicked the blazing sticks away from the
      building&#8212;and then made a dash for the door. He was now afraid of the
      mob and did not leave the house again that night. Good old boy</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Sandy, Pal, Protector. Just why
      you were out with those guerillas that night has never been explained to
      me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father did not come back into the house, and my
      mother believed that he had been killed, or mortally wounded, as she could
      plainly hear the groans of the dying man outside. And she was, of course,
      frantic with grief. After hours of agony, when she could stand it no
      longer, she took a lighted candle and went outside to investigate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My mother&#8217;s name was Martha. The wounded man kept
      groaning, &#8220;Oh, Lordy.&#8221; And my mother thought it was my father
      calling her name. It took some tension off when she discovered the dying
      man was not my father</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      she was horrified to find he was the son of a close neighbor. The young
      man asked for a drink of water, and wanted someone to pray for his soul.
      She gave him water. And she prayed for him. At daybreak the young man&#8217;s
      companions took him to his father&#8217;s home where he died a few hours
      later. He told his people that he got what he deserved, that he had no
      business in permitting the mob to persuade him to go out with them that
      night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Still my mother did not know the fate of my father</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and of course her mind and nerves
      were harassed to the point of breaking all through the long hours of the
      night. In this story I can only give the facts and trust that some power
      of understanding in every human heart may lead the reader to some
      appreciation of the tense situation&#8212;the web of destiny seemingly
      inextricably entangled, in which my parents had been caught.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After shooting his way out, my father had kept on
      going, and under protection of the night and the dense woods surrounding
      the house, eluded the mob. And after fifteen miles of weary tramping over
      the hills and through woods, after hours of worry for the safety of his
      family, he reached the Union lines, at daybreak. In the afternoon of that
      same day the family was moved to Clarksville, by solders sent out from the
      army.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The guerillas had burned my father&#8217;s tanyard and
      shoeshop, and his tobacco barn. They had stolen his horses</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">four fine grays which were kept on the plantation for
      plowing the tobacco fields and for hauling tanbark. And in the end,
      someone stole his farm. The trusted agent forgot to remit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father then went as a scout with detachments the
      Union army. He served under Major E. N. Morrill, who was later Governor of
      Kansas, and a resident of Hiawatha for a number of years. The guerilla
      band was broken up. But hostilities did not stop altogether with the
      surrender of Lee. And bushwhacking&#8221; became a pastime with the
      embittered few.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My mother, with her sister, Nan Porter, went back to
      Tennessee some years later for a visit. And about the first thing they did
      was to attend church&#8212;a new church in the old neighborhood. My
      resident aunt</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Aunt Harriet
      Lovell&#8212;had said to her sisters, &#8220;You-all will meet lots of
      friends after church.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The two Kansas women, with their handsome and deeply
      religious young escort, marched into church a trifle late, and my mother
      was smiling and nodding to close seated old acquaintances, and properly
      attuned, all were living in the happy anticipation of a real love feast
      when church would be out. Then suddenly, abruptly, as if she had received
      some deadly stroke, the smile faded from her face. She looked at her
      sister, in crestfallen dejection, and whispered, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
      out of here, Nan, just as soon as the services are over.&#8221; That
      pained look did not belong on my my mother&#8217;s sweet face. Some highly
      disturbing thing had happened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Quickly, my mother revised her plans. She could
      consistently have waited for the preacher to come down from the pulpit and
      address her as &#8220;sister&#8221; with more significance than ordinarily
      accrues to the church going woman. But no, thank you&#8212;not my mother.
      Not in that spot. She had recognized in that coarse-voiced preacher the
      leader of that guerilla mob. He was my non-consanguineous uncle</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">father&#8217;s own
      brother-in-law. And the accommodating young man who had been so kind as to
      &#8220;carry&#8221; them over in his shiny new buggy could not understand
      what made them in such a hurry to get away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">That meeting house was set in a small clearing in the
      dense woods on top of a high ridge. It was called &#8220;Sentinary.&#8221;
      The worshippers came in from the lower settlements from every direction.
      It was their custom to tarry after services for a visit</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and especially^ if there were strangers in the
      congregation they must be wholeheartedly welcomed, Southern style, as I
      was to learn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Some years later it was my pleasure to attend that
      same church. And Walter Cox &#8220;carried&#8221; me over in his buggy&#8212;the
      same rig in which my mother and my aunt had ridden with him&#8212;though
      the buggy was now, of course, somewhat the worse for wear, as the roads
      down there are rocky. Fully half that four-mile trip was in the bed of a
      creek which flowed, clear as crystal, over a rock bottom, between high
      hills. And when not in the middle of the creek that road crossed and
      recrossed the stream many times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But the guerilla-preacher&#8212;he of the &#8220;foghorn&#8221;
      voice</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">who had so disturbed
      my mother&#8217;s tranquility, was not at the Church to greet me. It was
      my uncle, one of my mother&#8217;s rank rebel&#8221; brothers, who stepped
      down from the pulpit to meet the stranger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And when Walter Cox introduced us&#8212;after effusive
      greetings and some emotional tears from the older man</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">uncle, with fine Southern accent, said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
      powerful proud that Walter here didn&#8217;t introduce you before the
      services. If I had known one of sister Martha&#8217;s boys was the
      congregation I believe I would have forgotten my text.&#8221; He stroked
      his whiskers. &#8220;Yes, suh, it would have frustrated me a heap.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Having registered at the Maxwell House&#8212;the one that
      presumably made a certain brand of coffee famous&#8212;I attended the
      Nashville Centennial for three days before looking up any of my relatives.
      My Uncle Thomas Cullom lived Nashville</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but my Aunt Nancy Cullom-Porter had written from Wetmore to
      my Aunt Harriet Cullom-Lovell at Newsome Station, twelve miles out, of my
      expected visit&#8212;and I went there first, by train. I inquired at the
      Newsome store for a way to get out to John Lovell&#8217;s, five miles up
      Buffalo creek. Mr. Newsome said, &#8220;Just go right down to the mill,
      the boy there will carry you over plum to his door&#8212;you a Cullom?&#8221;
      The boy led out two horses, and I was &#8220;carried&#8221; over astride a
      horse to my Aunt&#8217;s home, arriving at about four o&#8217;clock. And
      here I met, for the first time, Uncle John Lovell, his two daughters, Emma
      and Margaret; and of course my Aunt Harriet&#8212;not however, for the
      first time. My mother had told me that we had been pretty good friends in
      my baby days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, I met here the renowned spirit medium Jim Spain,
      of whom I had heard my mother and my Aunt Nancy tell some tall stories&#8212;but
      Jim got on a horse, rode away, and I did not see him again that day. Jim
      Spain at this me was about thirty-five years old. He had come to the
      Lovell home when a young man&#8212;and just stayed. I don&#8217;t know if
      he had any relatives; though undoubtedly there was a time when he might
      have been blessed&#8212;or plagued&#8212;with kin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At eventide&#8212;maybe it would define the hour better
      to say as dusk settled on the hills and hollows surrounding my Aunt&#8217;s
      home, making the hollows thick with semi-darkness&#8212;girls, in twos and
      threes, began coming in&#8212;in all about a baker&#8217;s dozen. That
      spirit medium had made the rounds spreading the news of my arrival. The
      girls were too nearly the same age&#8212;sweet sixteen&#8212;to be of one
      family. They were my relatives</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">or maybe just relatives of my relatives. They were all
      cousins. I asked one of the girls where had they all come from? She said,
      &#8220;Just over the east hill&#8212;apiece.&#8221; It was a steep hill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Lovell home, a double structure with the usual
      open spacious gallery separating the apartments&#8212;a typical Southern
      home&#8212;was near the junction of Buffalo creek on the north and a deep
      gulch between high wooded hills, flowing in from the south. The building
      spot, about the size of an ordinary town lot, had been leveled off some
      fifteen feet above the wash, with the west end of the dwelling resting on
      piles reaching down almost to the water level. To the east, the hill above
      the flattened space, was so steep and high that the sun did not&#187;
      shine on the house until after ten o&#8217;clock. A cook-house stood in
      the yard about thirty feet south of the dwelling where family meals were
      prepared&#8212;presumedly by a colored cook.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Here, I must explain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After I had returned home, I learned that my Aunt Nancy
      had written my Aunt Harriet advising her to get rid of her Negro cook for
      the duration of my visit. Whatever possessed her to do this, I wouldn&#8217;t
      know&#8212;there was, in fact, no justification for it. I had no reason to
      be prejudice of Negroes. On the contrary, I may say I &#8220;owe my life&#8221;
      to a Negro</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">my mother said
      he was the blackest Negro she had ever seen&#8212;for having rescued me
      from the river after I had fallen off the deck of the boat, when coming to
      Kansas from Tennessee. I was about four years old&#8212;and still wearing
      dresses, in the fashion of the times. I was told that the Negro said he
      had saved my mother&#8217;s little darling girl. I didn&#8217;t like to be
      called a &#8220;little girl&#8221;&#8212;either with or without the
      &#8220;darling&#8221;&#8212;but this was no cause for me to forever
      dislike the colored folk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Might say I was nearly six years old before I got my
      first pants&#8212;and even then I didn&#8217;t wear them regularly. They
      were knee pants&#8212;in style, which style endured for a long time. I
      knew one young fellow in Wetmore who wore his knee-pants right up to his
      wedding day. When I first began howling for pants, my mother said I was
      lucky she hadn</span> <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c0">t dressed me
      in a flour sack, with holes cut out for head and arms, like Preacher
      Wamyer&#8217;s kids had been clothed, in our neighborhood. But the joke
      was, she did not happen to have a flour sack, and she said that in this
      God-for-saken country she was not likely to have one for ages. My mother
      made me shirts with long tails</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">and when around home out there in the sticks, in hot
      weather, I would not bother with the britches. I recall the time mother
      took me with her to a quilting at the home of one of the Porter women&#8212;it
      might have been at the home of Kate Evans, wife of Bill Evans, the famous
      old stage-driver; but more likely it was the home of Amanda Ann Watson,
      widow, who later married Brown Ellet. Johnny Bill Watson, a red headed,
      freckled face boy about my age, played rough, making it plenty hot for me.
      I pulled off my pants, went into the house, and threw my britches onto the
      quilting frame&#8212;greatly humiliating my mother, and creating uproarous
      laughter from the women.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, you know, I didn&#8217;t see a &#8220;Nigger&#8221;
      or even hear one mentioned during my visit at my Aunt Harriet&#8217;s
      home, That cook house was the one place not exploited. But somehow the
      meals got cooked&#8212;tempting meals just like my mother used to cook&#8212;and
      I suspect by Auntie Lovell&#8217;s regular colored woman, after the Cullom
      technique.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The smoked ham, produced and cured on the place, was
      the best I have ever eaten. Uncle and Auntie&#8217;s 200-acre farm lay in
      irregular boundaries&#8212;likely described by chains and links
      zig-zagging between blazed trees&#8212;for two miles up and down Buffalo
      creek. Uncle John showed me the limestone ledge protruding over the north
      bank of the creek, which sheltered his hogs at such times as they would
      come home to spend the night&#8212;and feed on perhaps the first &#8220;bar&#8217;l&#8221;
      of corn produced on a near-by clearing. The hogs came home only at such
      times as the &#8220;mast&#8221; was insufficient. This combination made
      for cheap pork&#8212;and delicious hams.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I had recently been in Texas&#8212;and because of that
      trip to the Lone Star state, I had a message from a relative to a relative
      to be delivered in Nashville. Here again I should explain. On learning
      that I planned a trip to Galveston ten days hence, my Aunt Nancy Porter
      asked me to stop off at Dallas and call on a relative&#8212;a Cullom of
      the Tennessee tribe. I believe his name was Jerry. But if he were not
      Jerry, he was a close relative. When I called at Mr. Cullom&#8217;s real
      estate office in Dallas, I was told he had gone to Galveston. I went on to
      Galveston, and dismissed all thought of seeing my relative. I went out to
      the beach, and while strolling on the sands&#8212;on the gulf side of the
      sea-wall</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">among hundreds,
      perhaps thousands of other strollers, fell in with a friendly man. He told
      me he was from Dallas, and I told him that I was from Wetmore,&#8222;Kansas.
      He said, quickly, &#8220;Did you say Wetmore? Reckon you might know my
      cousin Nan Porter, there.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Then, I reckon you
      know that my Aunt Nancy asked me to stop off at Dallas, and call on you.&#8221;
      He grabbed my hand, saying with real Tennessee accent, &#8220;Mr. John
      Bristow, I&#8217;m powerful proud to meet you.&#8221; Again, I may be
      wrong. It could have been the Texas accent. In the course of our
      conversation I told Cousin Cullom that I would be going to Nashville for
      the Centennial, and he said likely he would go, too. The message from him
      was for my Aunt Tennessee Cullom-Clark, mother&#8217;s sister, living in
      North Nashville.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I may say I&#8217;m &#8220;powerful proud&#8221; that my
      meddlesome letter-writing Aunt Nancy took it upon herself to notify our
      Texas cousin of my intended visit. That rather unusual chance meeting is
      paralleled by another chance meeting</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">which opens the way for bringing into this writing my
      distinguished Kansas cousin. I had an engagement to meet J.L.Bristow at
      the Eldridge Hotel in Lawrence, when he was Fourth Assistant Postmaster
      General</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">later, U. S.
      senator from Kansas. He was of my father&#8217;s branch of the Virginia
      and Tennessee Bristows, a third cousin to me, and up to this time we had
      never met. He was billed as principal speaker at a Republican rally in the
      Bowersock Opera House that night. Upon my arrival in Lawrence about noon,
      I discovered he was registered at the Eldridge House&#8212;but I could not
      locate him. I went out to the Kansas-Nebraska football game, and got a
      seat by a man who seemed to be deeply interested in the game. We conversed
      in an off-hand way when he was not up on his toes rooting for the Kansas
      team. From the conversation I inferred that he was a newspaper man, like
      myself. But, unlike myself, he was a college man. Not being a college man,
      I could not get interested in the game. It was brutal. When we had fetched
      up at the Eldridge House, this football enthusiast&#8212;now surrounded by
      politicians&#8212;said to me. &#8220;I am told by the clerk here that you
      were looking for me, and it seems you failed recognize a relative when you
      had found him.&#8221; He was my man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Might say I first learned of my Kansas cousin when he was
      owner and publisher of the Salina Daily Republican, and I was publishing
      the Wetmore Spectator. A Kansas City printing firm addressed a letter to
      J. L. Bristow, Wet-more, Kansas&#8212;one initial off from my own. It was
      delivered to me. The contents of the letter showed that it should have
      been sent to the other newspaper man in Salina. I mailed it to him. He
      came back promptly wanting to know from whom did I get my name? One more
      exchange letters told us both exactly who we were. We both claimed kin to
      old Ben</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">of Virginia,
      Kentucky, and New York fame&#8212;though I do not now recall his
      specialty. But it&#8217;s a safe bet it had to do with politics. My father
      was a first cousin of J. L.&#8217;s father, a Methodist minister, living
      in Baldwin, Kansas. My illustrious cousin Joseph has climbed high up the
      ladder of political fame</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      who knows his limit? I shall not lose track of him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After I would have returned from Pensacola, Florida, and
      spent a day in Nashville with Uncle Tom and Aunt Irene Cullom, and their
      three daughters, cousins Lora, Clevie, and Myrtle, it was planned to give
      a party for me at Aunt Harriet&#8217;s country home, the day set for one
      week hence</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">when they
      &#8220;allowed&#8221; they really would show me some Tennessee girls.
      Here, I think my Wetmore Auntie had been meddling in my behalf once again.
      Well, no matter. If it was meant that the girls at the coming party would
      grade upwards in looks from the first showing, it surely would be worth
      coming back for. Cousin Maggie Lovell, a fifteen-year-old beauty, told me
      the girls would turn themselves loose at the party&#8212;and, she said,
      &#8220;The woods are full of &#8216;em.&#8221; The girls of the advance
      showing had been rather on the reserved order&#8212;I might say very
      lady-like. Still, I imagine there were missies in that group who would
      have been pleased to start something. Also, I imagine they were the flower
      of the flock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">All Southern girls at that time were supposed to be
      pretty. The climate, and the care in which the girls were taught to shield
      their faces from the sun was believed to make for superior beauty. My
      mother said that in her day no girl would ever think of going out without
      her sun-bonnet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Admittedly, the South is blessed with some extremely
      beautiful girls. But, after extensive searching, may I say that&#8212;exempting
      cousins of course&#8212;I did not find it overwhelmingly so. I am
      convinced that it takes something more than climate and ribbed sun-bonnets
      to turn the trick; and that the South has no monopoly on this something.
      Also, I further find that the strikingly beautiful girl is, like
      -prospector&#8217;s gold, where you find her. And for my money give me the
      sun-kissed girl from the wide-open Kansas range.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Unfortunately, I was called home, and did not have the
      pleasure of attending the party&#8212;and was compelled to send regrets,
      from Nashville, by mail. Also, I missed the chance to see Jim Spain call
      up the spirits. But then it was only a half promise. When I asked Jim if
      he would hold a seance for me, he said, &#8220;Reckon I might&#8212;but
      generally I aim to do it only for the hill folks.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;But,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you fooled my mother
      and my Aunt Nancy when they were down here not so long ago.&#8221; He said
      &#8220;Yes&#8212;I did. But you know they grew up here in the South where
      most everybody believes in ghosts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;My mother used to tell us kids that there was
      no such thing as a ghost&#8212;but she said it in such a dispirited way as
      to cause me, as young as I was, to doubt if she fully believed her own
      words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I grew up in a generation which talked freely, pro and
      con, about ghosts. And, believe it or not, I have actually seen Erickson&#8217;s
      ghost&#8212;that is, until the apparition faded away into something
      tangible, as &#8220;ghosts&#8221; always do if given time. There was a
      time here when I</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">and other
      youngsters of like caliber&#8212;looked for Erickson&#8217;s ghost in
      every dark corner. And I think that if I should even now go through the
      woods on the old Hazeltine farm adjoining town, at night, as I often did
      in the early days, I would involuntarily keep an eye peeled for the ghost
      of Jim Erickson, a murderer and suicide, of May 10, 1873&#8212;buried,
      without benefit of clergy, mourners, or even regulation coffin</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">on top a high hill just south of
      town. To mention only one of the several proclaimed haunted houses&#8212;which
      always go hand in hand with ghosts&#8212;Jim Erickson&#8217;s ghost cut up
      a good many capers here in the early days, particularly where &#8220;it&#8221;
      was often &#8220;seen&#8221; on the margin of the big swamp lying between
      town and the high hill. Let there come a foggy night someone was sure to
      say: &#8220;Erickson&#8217;s ghost will stalk tonight.&#8221; A party of
      three young couples&#8212;boys and girls</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">set out one night to trap old Jim, or whatever it was that
      haunted a vacant house of many rooms, which sat on a high hill near the
      swamp&#8212;but, would you believe it, they were disturbed by another
      couple who had preceded them&#8212;and all fled the scene in a rout.
      Actually, some brave people</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">grown-up&#8217;s&#8212;positively
      refused to venture south of the creek on foggy nights. It&#8217;s not a
      promise&#8212;but I may, at some future date, write the Erickson story for
      the Spectator readers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And I can well believe Jim Spain had the situation as
      to ghosts stalking among the oldsters of his generation in the South sized
      up correctly. However, the bright kids of today should never be troubled
      with any such hallucinations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">No, kids&#8212;truly, there is no such thing as a
      ghost. My mother told me so.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">NOTE&#8212;Cousin Bill Porter recently visited
      Nashville, and was told that Jim Spain (having died in cousin Margaret
      Lovell-Ezell&#8217;s home in Nashville in 1948, aged 84) is only a memory
      down there now.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">It was early autumn far back in the pioneer days. The
      wood which this story opens was one of the largest stands big trees in
      Northeast Kansas. It was bordered on the high slopes with sumac,
      hazelbrush, and tall grass. The trees had not yet fully shed their leaves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">An Indian, blanketed, with a long rifle swung across
      withers of his buckskin pony, detached himself from the band of rovers and
      rode straight to the place where my father and I stood, under a great oak
      tree, frozen to the spot. A foreboding stillness pervaded the oak grove. I
      was terribly frightened. Somehow the idea had formed in my young head that
      the Indians would not kill children; that they carried them off alive,
      along with the scalps of adult whites.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">About that time frequent accounts of Indian depredations

      <span class="c2 c0">A tribe of Indians lived then, as now, on a
      reservation only eight miles away. The fact that those Kickapoos were
      considered civilized and peaceable did not register in this all boy&#8217;s
      mind&#8212;nor even in some adult minds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father, William Bristow, was reared in the heavily
      wooded sections of Kentucky and Tennessee, where, in his day, the gun and
      the &#8220;hound-dog&#8221; were man&#8217;s dearest possessions. I knew
      that he was a crack rifle-shot; that he could, without doubt, hold his own
      with the advancing redman&#8212;but not against that band of savages
      lurking in the background. Wrapped in flaming blood-red blankets, those
      Indians, silent and sinister, with the long barrels of their rifles
      sticking up like telegraph poles, looked as if they might be making ready
      to go on the warpath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Closer and closer came the Indian. And why the devil
      didn&#8217;t my father shoot? Was he going to let that redskin take his
      scalp? In a fit of panic I dodged behind the big oak tree; and then just
      as suddenly I popped out again and backed up my father by clutching his
      trousers legs from behind. It is surprising what amount of terror can flit
      through a small boy&#8217;s mind in so short a time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In a flash I reviewed again the fate of the German
      girls, orphaned and stolen by the Indians. All oldtimers here will recall
      that the German girls&#8212;Kate, Sophia, Addie, and Julia&#8212;after
      being rescued from the Indians, became wards of the Government and were
      placed in the home of Pat Corney, who lived for many years on Wolfley
      creek. Their ages ranged from six to seventeen years when rescued. They
      were filthy dirty&#8212;grimy, without clothes. When the two younger girls
      were brought to the Corney home&#8212;the other two were recovered later&#8212;the
      old Irishman exclaimed: &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Louisa, get a tub of
      water and a bar of soap!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Also, about this time&#8212;probably a few years earlier</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">our townsman, Andy Maxwell, after
      leaving Wetmore to take up his home in the West, was besieged for three
      days by Sioux and Nez Perce Indians. With Andy were Mrs. Maxwell</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">his sister-in-law</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">his daughter May, and four men. They were traveling
      out of Miles City, Montana, in covered wagons. The story of this Indian
      encounter had filtered back to Wetmore where Andy Maxwell&#8217;s mother,
      a brother, and two sisters still lived. According to the report, Maxwell
      and his men took their stand in a small timber tract, on three sides of
      which were deep gullies. Owing to this advantageous position the Indians
      could not follow their customary tactics of circling the whites. They
      skulked. And whenever an Indian would get near enough, he would be picked
      off by the white man&#8217;s bullet. Maxwell and his men killed eight
      Indians. Two of the white men were severely wounded. May got an arrow
      through her foot; Andy lost a lock of his hair and had his face grazed by
      a bullet. Mrs. Maxwell was shot in the arm. The party lost twenty-six
      oxen. Andy Maxwell now lives at Santa Ana, California.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I have mentioned these two Indian incidents briefly,
      merely to give the reader some idea as to what was, and might have been,
      flashing through my mind at that tense moment&#8212;and for their historic
      value. Also other Indian pictures assailed me. That awful moment will
      stand out in my memory while life lasts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father said not a word, and to be sure I could not
      read his reactions. I knew only that he had been harboring a fine mess of
      mixed emotions at the moment when the Indians appeared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mark this well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;How!&#8221; greeted the Indian as he drew rein.
      He slid off his pony and surveyed the surroundings quickly. At edge of the
      clearing his redskin companions, departing from their single-file
      formation, sitting on their ponies, went into a huddle not unlike modern
      collegiate intelligentsia on a gridiron.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Though it may be said that the Indian&#8217;s mission
      was of rather urgent nature, let us leave him standing here by the side of
      his pony while I tell you how my father and I happened to be caught in
      this embarrassing predicament.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">For some reason, undoubtedly well grounded, the owner
      of that timber forbade hunting on his premises. Nevertheless, on one
      occasion, that ban was lifted in promise, if not in reality&#8212;and
      therein lies the nucleus of this tale.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">One day while on a friendly call at the shoeshop in
      Wetmore, John Wolfley granted permission to my father to shoot squirrels
      in his timber, though he made it plain that this was to be considered a
      special favor, because of old friendship. My father and John Wolfley, the
      senior John, were among the first settlers in this country. They came
      before the railroads, before the towns in this section&#8212;in the log
      cabin days. The towns then were strung along the old land or military road
      passing five miles north of here. As compared with highways of the present
      day, it was not a road. It was but a rut, a serpentine streak of dust
      spanning the great plains, crossing the mountains&#8212;and on to
      California. Yet, it carried immense traffic&#8212;stage, pony express,
      commerce</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and was a
      celebrated thoroughfare. Many notables passed this way. U. S. Grant,
      Horace Greeley, Mark Twain. And although of no particular moment here, I
      might add that I, myself, came into this country over the Old Trail at a
      time when traffic was near its peak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was, therefore, in considerable blitheness of
      spirit that on one fine October day my father and I &#8220;hoofed it&#8221;
      five miles up Spring creek to the Wolfley timber. We were going to a
      choice and restricted hunting grounds, on invitation of the owner&#8212;a
      favor granted no one else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My father shot a squirrel. The report of his gun, heard
      by the owner of the place who was in the timber gathering down-wood&#8212;sometimes
      in the old days called squaw wood</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">brought a vigorous protest from a half-hidden spot across
      the creek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Get out!&#8221; the angry voice shouted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father was not disturbed. Not then. He even laughed
      a little. And I fear his voice was charged with rather too much mirth when
      he called back across the stream, &#8220;Why, John, don&#8217;t you know
      me?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Like a flash of lightning came back the ultimatum,
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if you are General Grant, you can&#8217;t hunt
      in my timber!&#8221; So that was that&#8212;a sorry situation for two old
      friends to impose upon themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father told me we would leave the Wolfley timber by
      the shortest route. Leaving the dead squirrel on the ground where it had
      fallen, he started off at once with the stride of one bent upon urgent
      enterprise, muttering incoherent but indubitably uncomplimentary things
      about his late friend. It is such breaches of friendship, as this seemed
      to be, that cause men to talk to themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sometimes, however, what we consider a calamity proves
      to be a blessing in disguise. That was true in this case. And the breach,
      which loomed so menacingly on the horizon at the moment, instead of
      impairing a fine friendship was the indirect cause of making it
      everlasting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Even as my father hastened away, the Invisible Hand was
      working in his favor. Had there been no interruption, he would have
      continued on his course as mapped out, up the creek, and the providential
      thing which was very soon to take place would have miscarried. Here I want
      to interpose a paragraph&#8212;maybe two, or more&#8212;to show how
      welcome this providential thing that was now about to enter my father</span>
      <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c2 c0">s life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A shoemaker with a family rather too large to support
      in comfort even in normal times, was my father&#8212;a slaving man who,
      like so many others in those pioneer days, had nearly reached the limit of
      his endurance. In this new country everyone was directly, or indirectly,
      dependent upon the products of the soil. Those were the days of Texas
      long-horn cattle and ten cent corn&#8212;when there was corn. Those were
      the days when snows driven by winter&#8217;s howling blasts across the
      open prairies piled high in the streets and country lanes and cut off all
      communications with the outside world for weeks at a time. At such times
      we would burn corn for fuel. Well do I remember the superior warmth of
      those corn-fed fires. They were life-savers for those who were compelled
      to live in the open, wind-blown homes of that day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was land to be had for the taking, but my father
      thought he could not afford to take it. Without capital to stock the free
      grass range, the pioneer farmer could not hope to make more than a bare
      living. And when crops failed for lack of moisture, as they too often did
      in the early days before the country became seasonable for the production
      of grain, all suffered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">That was pioneer Kansas! That was &#8220;Droughty Kansas!</span>
      <span>&#8221;</span> <span class="c2 c0">That was &#8220;Bleeding Kansas!&#8221;
      It was not the Kansas of today&#8212;barring, of course, the year 1934,
      and maybe with apologies for 1935.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, before that providential find was to bear fruit,
      two outstanding reverses visited appalling hardships upon an already
      discouraged peoples. The lingering effects of the great money panic of
      1873 was the cause of much distress. There was no such thing as Federal
      aid then, and everyone here was on his own. However, the East did
      contribute some bacon and a quantity of cast-off clothing, including plug
      hats and Prince Albert coats&#8212;useful in some cases, but generally
      scorned by the needy people.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That money panic was brought on by the collapse of the
      Jay Cooke brokerage houses in three eastern cities. Cooke, a nationally
      known promoter, was financing the building of the Northern Pacific
      railroad, and had made too many advances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It may be of interest here, especially in Nemaha and
      Jackson counties and possibly throughout all Northeast Kansas, to know
      that, later, through an unprotected brokerage partnership in the National
      Capitol with that wizard of finance, a former resident of Wetmore
      township, Green Campbell, who had come into local and national prominence
      by reason of his sensational rise to affluence as principal owner of the
      famous Horn Silver mine at Frisco, Utah, dropped a cool million of his
      mine-made dollars in the aftermath of that failure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After he had failed, Jay Cooke, still the promoter
      par-excellence, secured a railroad for Green Campbell&#8217;s mine. Later,
      after he had sold his mine, Campbell went to Washington as delegate to
      Congress from Utah. Still later Campbell joined Cooke there in the
      brokerage business. With new money in the firm, Cooke&#8217;s old
      creditors swooped down upon Campbell like a swarm of bees. And they stung
      him hard. His first check was drawn for nine hundred thousand dollars!
      However, there was no time after selling the Horn Silver mine that Green
      Campbell was not a rich man. Green Campbell endowed a college at Holton,
      Kansas, bearing his name. His old homestead was in the southwest part of
      Wetmore township. It is now owned and occupied by August Krotzinger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then there was the year 1874&#8212;a blank year with
      its train of blighted hopes that socked the whole populace still deeper
      down into the slough of despond. Following a season of scanty production,
      the crops that year, in the spring and up to mid-summer, showed signs of
      fulfillment. Then came the usual anxious period&#8212;dry, windy,
      scorching days, And hope, that had sprung in the tired hearts of the
      farmers commenced to die as they looked with anxiety on the drooping
      crops. The people prayed for rain. They watched for clouds. Then, out of
      the northwest there came a cloud&#8212;a black cloud, a menacing cloud,
      that was to blot out all renaming hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It was a rain of pests&#8212;a deluge of grasshoppers!
      Like the plagues of old they descended upon us. And they greedily devoured
      every growing thing&#8212;corn, grass, weeds, foliage of the trees&#8212;leaving
      in their wake a barren waste and a woefully impoverished lot of people.
      After devouring every edible thing, and gnawing on pitchfork handles and
      axe handles</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">for salt
      deposited by sweaty hands</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">the
      hoppers deposited eggs in the ground, and then perished with the coming of
      cold weather. The young hoppers in the spring of 1875 cleaned up the
      farmer&#8217;s first plantings&#8212;but on a day, at noon, late in June
      they rose up as a cloud blotting out the sun from the earth as they winged
      their way to greener pastures&#8212;where, nobody here knew.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now we have left the Indian standing there by the side
      of his pony for a long time. But the Indian doesn&#8217;t mind. Not our
      Kickapoo, anyway. And, as a stickler for the truth, for accuracy of
      detail, I will admit that my deductions, my fears, did not coincide with
      the facts as later developed; that, in the language of the street and as
      my father said of me at the time out there in the wood&#8212;literally, I
      was &#8220;all wet.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That Indian was not an emissary of destruction,
      rather, he was, after the manner of the wise one of his peoples, a maker
      of good medicine. My father&#8217;s great haste to get away from the
      Wolfley timber had been halted by a clump of black oak trees. There were
      two holes in a large limb of the great oak under which the Indian found us
      standing. The Indian looked up into the tree. &#8220;Long time go Indian&#8217;s
      tomahawk make holes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe catchum coon,&#8221; He
      shifted his beady black eyes to another part of the tree, and exclaimed,
      &#8220;Seeum squirrel!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father had hot noticed the holes in the limb, nor
      the squirrel which the Indian saw flattened out on a branch high up in the
      tree. To my father, that tree presented far more interesting
      possibilities. Before interrupted, his thoughts had, more or less, shifted
      from the man who had treated him so shabbily and had carried him back to
      the sunny Southland, to the evergreen hills of his boyhood home. There he
      had successfully operated a tannery&#8212;successfully, until the Civil
      War put him out of business.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The tree my father was now viewing was a huge black
      oak. It was surrounded by more of its kind. At any time the sight of a
      black oak attracted him. Black oak bark was the agency he employed in
      making leather in his Tennessee tannery. He longed to get back into the
      business. There were other black oaks in the country; yet he questioned if
      there were enough to justify the establishment of a tannery here. He was
      constantly on the lookout for a substitute for making leather.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Pointing to the boots he himself wore, my father told
      the Indian that his interest in that tree was because the bark of the
      black oak was used in making leather. Also, noticing that the Indian was
      wearing moccasins and other deerskin raiment under his blanket, my father
      asked him what the Indians used for tanning. The Indian became thoughtful
      and finally said something that sounded like &#8220;Sequaw.&#8221; But
      that was worse than Greek to my father.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is fitting that I pause here to pay tribute to one
      of those little borderlets mentioned in the opening paragraph. Resplendent
      in its lofty setting that little borderlet, and its kind, possessed
      priceless properties. Henceforth it becomes golden thread in the woof and
      warp of this tale. As with the lovely Claudette Colbert and her coca-cola
      tidings, this is, in a manner, &#8220;the pause that refreshes.&#8221; And
      so being, it is with memorable pleasure that I now salute the sumac! It
      was my father&#8217;s salvation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back in the Wolfley timber, my father told the Indian
      the owner did not permit hunting on his premises&#8212;that he, the
      tanner, was not interested in the squirrel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Me shoot &#8216;im,&#8221; said the Indian. The
      long barrel of his rifle pointed upwards&#8212;a sharp crack, and the
      squirrel fell the ground, shot through the head. The Indian picked up the
      squirrel, and then holding it out to the frightened little boy, said,
      &#8220;Take.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Without more ceremony the Indian rode away. He was
      gone only a few minutes. When he returned he was holding in his hand a
      branch of sumac. &#8220;Sequaw,&#8221; he said again. There were but a few
      belated red leaves clinging to the stem. &#8220;Catchum &#8216;fore go
      red,&#8221; he offered when he saw the leaves shattering in my father&#8217;s
      hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Indian&#8217;s sharp eyes surveyed the black oak
      again. He looked at the branch of sumac, saying &#8220;Makum buck-kin.&#8221;
      He hesitated. Then said, &#8220;Maybe killum deer &#8216;fore Sun go way.
      Maybe two suns. You seeum deer?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father told the Indian&#8212;whom he then and there
      named Eagle Eye&#8212;that he had not seen the deer which those redmen
      were trailing. Those Indians who had remained in the background were
      trying to conceal a deer which one of them had swung across his pony as
      they went into that huddle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The deer, more numerous in earlier days, had been
      pretty well killed out by this time. Though, as late as 1880, I, myself,
      shot a deer on that same run. Also I recall having seen one band of
      antelope, that fleet-footed little animal of deer family which could
      outrun the wind even in its then unhampered sweep across the prairies. I
      was too young to identify the little ruminants, but my father said they
      were antelope, and he was a hunter of the Daniel Boone type&#8212;in fact
      had hunted in Dan&#8217;s old territory, and he knew his game.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Here I will say the Indian, Na-che-seah, was the
      leader of that hunting party. He was tall, lithe, and straight as an
      arrow. In later years, with generous expansion of body, he was known as
      Big Simon. He died May 27, 1934. As I looked upon the still form of this
      good Indian, in his wigwam, on the day of the funeral, my mind drifted
      back across the years to the time of our first meeting&#8212;but instead
      of fear, it was now reverence that gripped me. Big Simon was a man of
      authority among the Indians for a great many years&#8212;though, contrary
      to newspaper reports, he was never chief. About his age, Big Simon would
      say, &#8220;Hundred years, maybe. Don&#8217;t know.&#8221; With the
      passing of Big Simon, Commodore Cat is the sole surviving member of the
      old, old tribe. He too may have been one of those blanketed redmen back
      there on that deer trail six decades ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The redman&#8217;s medicine was an invigorating tonic for
      my father&#8217;s frayed spirits. It seemed like God had sent that Indian
      just at the psychological moment</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">when my father&#8217;s depressed spirits needed bolstering
      so very much, when an anodyne for his ills was to be had by the blending
      of two agencies for making leather. Though he had never up to this time
      regarded it as a commercial agency, my father knew of course that sumac
      contained tannin. If the Indians could tan their deerskins with it, he
      reasoned, why couldn&#8217;t he mix it with oak bark and tan his
      calfskins? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I shall always believe that it was something more than
      blind chance that brought the paths of white man and red man together at
      that particular spot. Undoubtedly, the Great Spirit was in control. The
      movements of the Indians up to that time were of course dark, but timed
      just right. And praise be, there were Indians&#8212;amongst them an Indian
      like Eagle Eye, who could make himself understood. The big break for my
      father was in the sumac patch close at hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After ten years absence from his old haunts and the
      business he loved so well, the fire in my father&#8217;s blood had cooled.
      Now he felt the old flame leap. The black oaks and the sumacs beckoned.
      And to his eager nostrils rose the odor of a tanyard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Almost at once after that meeting with the Indian, still
      nosing a tannery, my father was hot on the trail. With the characteristics
      of a thoroughbred, he doggedly followed his lead, picking up new hope as
      he went at almost every jump, into the woods of three counties. In a
      particularly fine stand of wood over in Jackson county, he &#8220;treed&#8221;
      his quarry. Looking up into the trees, his senses all aflame with
      eagerness, and I might say standing on his hind legs</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">upright anyhow</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">he barked, &#8220;Eureka!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then, having gone there on invitation of the owner to
      view those fine black oaks, standing tall, with their big boles close
      together, he said more rationally, but still with considerable enthusiasm,
      &#8220;It</span> <span>&#8217;</span> <span class="c2 c0">s enough! By God
      I&#8217;ll have that tannery now!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father had now declared quite emphatically, though
      perhaps a bit inelegantly, that he would establish a tannery here in
      Wetmore. It was not idle talk. He experimented, and in due time the
      tannery was a going concern. Not immediately, however. Capital had to be
      provided, and it took time to bring materials. The tannery was an &#8220;open&#8221;
      yard in the bend of the creek just west of where the town bridge is now&#8212;a
      sort of makeshift affair, operated only in the summer months. But in one
      respect it was regular. It had the tanyard smell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The black oak-sumac mixture made a fine grade of
      leather&#8212;much better than leather made with straight oak bark, and
      superior to the present-day chemically tanned leather. My father tanned
      only calfskins. His surplus stock was sold to L. Kipper &amp; Sons,
      wholesale dealers, Atchison, Kansas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I want to say here that those inviting black oaks,
      earlier mentioned, made it easy for my father to graciously accept his
      friend&#8217;s apology, on the plea of forgetfulness&#8212;and when he
      went to deal for the trees John Wolfley said, &#8220;Why, yes, of course
      you may have them. You know, Bristow, much as I prize my trees, I couldn&#8217;t
      refuse an old friend like you.&#8221; He glanced toward me, and now I&#8217;ll
      swear there were mirthful crinkles playing about the man&#8217;s eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The black oaks were cut in the spring when the sap was
      up, then the bark was spudded off the trunks of the trees. All available
      black oaks within a radius of twenty-five miles of Wetmore were cleaned up
      in three years. The last tan-bark came from the Wingo farm near Soldier,
      twenty miles away&#8212;wagon haul. That was considered a long haul in
      those days. The roads here then were no more than winding trails across
      country, radiating in every direction from town, like the spokes in a
      wagon-wheel. And there were almost no bridges. The creeks were forded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The sumac</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">that
      innocent little flaming bush, over which young and inexperienced writers
      are wont to revel</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">was cut
      with corn-knives and left spread on the ground until dry. The leaves were
      then stripped off the stems with a little corn-sheller, the kind that
      fastened on the hand. The sumac stems were drawn through the closed
      shelter and the leaves were caught upon a large canvas. Like harvesting
      tanbark, that was work which had to be done in season&#8212;not too soon,
      not too late.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The time to get busy was when the sumac began to show a
      tinge of coloring late in the summer, after maturity. But, as the Indian
      had said, when the big splash came</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">when the sumac thickets took on a blaze of coloring, that
      dark crimson hue, as if Nature had spilled the life-blood of the waning
      summer to glorify the last minute splendor of its passing&#8212;it was
      then time to quit. The leaves would no longer remain on the stems to carry
      through the drying process. Yes! That was it! &#8220;Catchum &#8216;fore
      go red!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father made Eagle Eye a pair of boots with leather
      tanned by the new process. He gave them to the Indian, Eagle Eye wanted to
      pay for them. He had Government money and he had ponies. When money was
      refused, he thought a pony would be about right. Maybe two, three or even
      a herd of ponies would not be too much. But my father said, &#8220;No,
      just bring me a deerskin sometime.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Indian brought him a green buffalo hide. At that time
      all swell turnouts&#8212;horse and buggy conveyances</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">included a buffalo robe. When, in time, the hide had
      been tanned and made up, my father found himself in the rather awkward
      position of owning a buffalo robe without the turn-out. But even so it was
      not a worthless treasure. On cold, stormy, winter nights&#8212;they were
      bitter cold then&#8212;it served as an extra bed coverlet for a quarter of
      a dozen of his boys, with, at times, an additional neighbor boy or two
      thrown in for good measure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Buffalo were quite plentiful only a hundred miles or
      so west of here then. But our Kickapoos did not often venture west of the
      Blue River. Hostile Indians roamed that territory. The Pawnees were the
      worst Indians the whites had to contend with on the old Overland Trail
      between the Big Blue and Fort Kearney. Eagle Eye&#8217;s gift was all the
      more appreciated because he had braved the hostile Pawnees to get a
      suitable present for his &#8220;Paleface&#8221; friend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The boots my father made for the Indian were of the
      tongue pattern, with morocco tops and small high heels. The tops were
      scalloped with half-moons over red sheepskin. A big red heart was
      fashioned in the top front. Eagle Eye was very proud of his boots. They
      were, I believe, the first boots to be worn on the reservation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But, in time, one of those boots ripped. The side seam
      gaped near the ankle. The Indian had been walking through wet grass when
      he came to the shop to get the rip sewed up. He tried to pull his boot
      off. It stuck tight. My father did not have a bootjack. He always said he
      did not like to have his perfectly fashioned boot-counters ruined by the
      use of a boot-jack. He had a better way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father turned his back to the Indian, and told
      Eagle Eye to stick his boot between his&#8212;the shoemaker&#8217;s&#8212;legs
      and push with the other foot. &#8220;Harder, push harder!&#8221; cried the
      human boot-jack. When the boot finally came off, a first-class shoemaker
      took a header into a pile of lasts and other rubbish in the corner of the
      room. He came up with a skinned nose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Indian&#8212;who had now come to call himself
      Eagle Eye when in the presence of my father&#8212;did not, of course get
      any kick out of hurting his &#8220;paleface&#8221; friend, but it was
      plain to be seen that pleasant thoughts were engaging him. An Indian
      laughs rarely, if ever&#8212;not the old Indians two generations back,
      anyway. But he had his moments of extreme pleasure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When the rip was repaired, the Indian had a hard time
      getting his water-soaked boot back on. My older brother, Charley, said to
      me, &#8220;Eagle Eye will have to sleep with his boots on tonight.&#8221;
      The Indian heard. His copper-colored face again registered anticipated
      pleasure. He actually smiled a bit as if he saw real humor in the thing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he grunted, as he raised his foot
      and thrust it to the fore with much vigor, &#8220;Pushum squaw maybe! Heap
      fool squaw all time say Eagle Eye not smart!&#8221;</span>

      you put that whole peach in your mouth?&#8221; She of course had not seen

    </h1>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">Not Hitherto Published&#8212;1947.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When harvesting sumac, often barefooted and always
      barehanded, we boys, sons of the tanner, had to keep a sharp lookout for
      rattlesnakes&#8212;and Texas cattle. We were repeatedly so warned by our
      parents. Also, it was generally understood that all children should
      &#8220;watchout&#8221; for Indians. This, however, did not greatly disturb
      us after we had made friends with Eagle Eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, one day, while cutting sumac for the tannery,
      with my brother Charley, near a timbered ravine three miles out southeast,
      close to the Oliver Logue farm, a long-horn steer, out of a large herd,
      chased me up a tree early in the afternoon and held me prisoner in the
      treetop until the riders, Abe Williams and John Taylor, came to round up
      the herd for the night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I thought that steer would surely butt his horns off,
      the way he rammed that six-inch tree. He would back off, paw the ground,
      shake his slobbering head, and come snorting at the tree again and again.
      After quieting down, he grazed fitfully and frightfully close to the tree&#8212;and
      he came trotting in several times with something ugly on his bovine mind,
      I&#8217;m sure. Even now I wonder is it possible for an enraged cowbrute
      to have red eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The day herder, at ease, on a ridge a quarter mile to
      the west&#8212;probably reading a Frank Merriwell baseball story&#8212;was
      letting the herd feed north, and so long as the cattle did not attempt to
      go over the rise to the east, out of sight, Wes Shuemaker would have no
      occasion to ride down my way. And it would have been futile for me to have
      tried to call him, with a south wind blowing forty-fifty mph.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My brother was safely on the other side of the ravine
      close to trees, but he slipped out the back way and went home. I knew he
      was doing the right thing. And I knew too that I would remain in the tree
      until the arrival of the riders. Those Texas cattle behaved nicely for
      mounted men, but they could not abide a person on foot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I really had no business on that side of the ravine,
      with those cattle feeding there&#8212;but I guess I was, as always, a
      little too venturesome. I knew that herd had some bad actors in it. In
      fact, I had been warned to never get off my horse when riding as relief
      herder of that same herd, on several occasions. And one time while all
      alone at the dinner hour my mount, in jumping a ditch, broke the saddle
      girth and spilled me on a rattlesnake infested prairie, amongst those
      longhorns&#8212;with not a tree in sight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, nothing untoward happened. Had my luck been
      running true to form, there should have been at least one rattlesnake
      coiled on the margin of the shallow ditch into which I squeezed myself,
      and waited in misery for the day herder to return. As I lay in the ditch I
      just had to recall the time, a short while before, when a rattlesnake,
      coiled by a cowpath, struck as I trotted past&#8212;barefoot, of course&#8212;and
      got his fangs hooked in my trouser leg, requiring two wild jumps to
      dislodge his snakeship.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The herd was owned by Than Morris and Abe Williams, the
      latter a brother of Mrs. Jake Wolfley. Morris and Wolfley were
      brothers-in-law. John Taylor, herder, was a son of Hebe Taylor, of
      Atchison. John Taylor was later bailiff of the Nemaha county court, in
      Seneca. And he was the father of Earl W. Taylor for whom the Seneca
      American Legion Post was named. Hebe Taylor also, at one time, ran cattle
      in the open country southwest of Wetmore</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">with Ed. Keggin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley went straight to the Morris general store in
      Wetmore and told Than of my predicament, and Morris immediately rounded up
      two cowpunchers. John Taylor, working with a herd to the southwest,
      chanced to be in town, and rode out with Abe Williams.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The herd had grazed on past my tree-perch. The unruly
      steer did not follow, but if the critter was capable of the sound thinking
      I was willing to credit him with, &#8220;I betcha&#8221; he always wished
      he had. A good cowhand could play a tune with a cattlewhip on a critter&#8217;s
      rump, under dead run. And John Taylor was good. He lashed his short-handled
      10-foot whip overhead to the steer&#8217;s rump, right and left, with
      rhythmic timing, making the hair fly with each crack. The steer&#8217;s
      hindparts, seemingly trying to outrun his foreparts, swung to the right
      and swung to the left with clocklike regularity&#8212;and he thus wove
      himself deep into the herd, bawling &#8220;bloody murder.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When told of John Taylor&#8217;s adroitness with the
      whip, my father said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care to tan his hide&#8221;&#8212;meaning
      the steer&#8217;s, of course. While father bought the hides from the lost
      dead of all those big herds&#8212;sometimes the losses in the early spring
      were heavy&#8212;he tanned only a few of them. He didn&#8217;t like to tan
      a mutilated hide, nor the hide of a branded critter&#8212;and he wouldn&#8217;t
      tan a grubby murrain hide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Thus it was, I herded the cattle that produced the
      hides that made the leather which I helped make into shoes&#8212;all while
      still in my teens. My apprenticeship as a shoemaker began by holding a
      candle for my father to work by, at night. And if you could think it was
      not a wearying task for a sleepy boy, you can think again. The light would
      have to be shifted from side to side with each stitch as he sewed the
      soles on shoes. By midnight he usually ran out of &#8220;endearing&#8221;
      terms by which to bring me to attention&#8212;and he was willing to call
      it a day. Sometimes my mother would relieve me of this chore, but too
      often at such times she would be engaged in sewing up the side seams of a
      new boot, with awl and waxed thread. While I did a lot of repair work
      satisfactorily, I made out and out only three pairs of shoes. And though
      always behind with his orders, my father very wisely demanded that I make
      them all to my own measures.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might add that we boys, sons of the tanner, and other
      rough and ready town boys&#8212;just to be doing something of our very own&#8212;tanned,
      in the big leather vats, squirrel hides, coon skins, and, of all things,
      two rattlesnake skins. Wes Shuemaker proudly wore the belt made of those
      rattlesnake skins for a long time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dr. Holland was another Atchison man who, in
      partnership with his brother-in-law, Mr. Prunty, of Soldier, ran a large
      herd southwest of town. His corral, a 10-acre pine board enclosure, was in
      the northwest corner of the Harry Cawood quarter. The land was then owned
      by Billy Cline, of Soldier. Where there were no corrals, a night herder
      would have to stay with the cattle.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Bradford spring&#8212;now known as the Joe Pfrang
      spring&#8212;gushing up from a hilltop, was the main attraction for those
      early day cattlemen. Just how the free range was divided up to carry
      several individual herds, without clashing, I do not know&#8212;but there
      were no cattle feuds, and no gunplay.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">NOTE&#8212;The values in cattle, as with everything
      else, ran low in the old days. An instance: In 1861, Bill Porter had a
      hard time raising money to pay taxes on two quarters of land. Unable to
      borrow $7.20, the troublesome amount, he walked and led a big fat cow to
      Leavenworth, and sold her for $7.50. In marked contrast, Garrett Bartley
      of Powhattan, son-in-law of Bill Porter, the second, reports a neighbor of
      his recently sold a 2,000 pound cow on the St. Joseph market for $540.00.
      I think the herds corralled here and grazed around the Bradford spring
      were bought for as little as $5 to $8 per head. This year&#8212;1950&#8212;Joe
      Pfrang, present owner of the Bradford spring and surrounding acres,
      bought, in May, a bunch of 700-pound steers for approximately $160.00 each&#8212;and
      after running them on pasture, the same wild grass, with some acres now
      planted to tame grass, sold them in the fall off grass, for an average of
      $270.00; a gain of about $110.00 per head. These steers were Texas-bred
      cattle, too. But they were not &#8220;longhorns.&#8221; Herefords never
      are. And likely the Pfrang 1,000-pound steers, out of the feed lot, with
      300 pounds added weight, would have sold for about $487.50 each. It was a
      great year for the cattlemen. Beefsteak in the old days in Wetmore was ten
      cents a pound for the best cuts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">There were, however, some angry threats between the
      cattlemen and Old Morgan, an outsider, who had run in four thousand sheep
      on them. I helped shepherd that flock, And I discovered early that by
      looping a pebble in the cracker end of my cattle-whip, and sending it over
      them a little to the outside of the straying sheep that I could bring them
      back into the fold without effort. Also, the singing noise of the pebble
      thrown over the flock would divide the sheep into two bunches. I really
      became quite good at this thing, and played with the discovery a lot</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">until one day when the missile
      did not sail true, and a sheep had to hobble home on three legs. We were
      in the hills south of the creek. The poor little lamb got no help until
      after the flock had passed over the bridge at the east end of town. Old
      Morgan usually met us there. Luckily, he was tuned up properly and did all
      the talking. He threatened to sue the township for permitting a hole to
      remain open in the bridge. This, I like to think, was the one black mark
      against my rather diversified career. A sheep herder in a cattle country
      rated pretty low. Cattle would not graze after sheep. I quit Old Morgan
      before the season was over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The cattle herder&#8217;s main function was to keep
      the herds from mixing, and to keep the cattle clear of the creek-bottom
      farms and the few isolated prairie farms; and also to keep them out of
      mischief in general, such as running down careless boys&#8212;and free of
      dogs. A dog could always start a stampede. And a cattle stampede was
      something to be dreaded, in the old days. When those Texas cattle and dogs
      mixed there was sure to be loud bellowings and a great clashing of hoofs
      and horns. I have a clear picture of my Uncle Nick&#8217;s herd of
      longhorns, after running themselves down, milling about on the range
      adjacent to his Wolfley creek farm&#8212;milling in a compact bunch, when
      one could look out upon a sea of horns; nothing but horns.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was quite the thing for local men who had a little
      cash, or backing, to take a hand in the cattle game. My Uncle Nick Bristow
      and Roland Van Amburg contracted for a large herd of those longhorns from
      Dr. W. L. Challis, cattle broker of Atchison. The cattle were fresh from
      Texas&#8212;brought up over the famed Chisholm trail. Uncle Nick and Van
      divided the herd, and after running the cattle on grass, tried to carry
      them through a rather severe winter on prairie hay alone. Those fresh
      longhorns would not eat corn. The cattle were so weakened by spring that
      when turned out on grass they mired down in creeks and water holes all
      over the range. They died in bunches, almost to the last head. And while
      that cattle deal cost my Uncle his farm, Van said it cost him only his
      &#8220;britches.&#8221; Roland Van Amburg was a grand old sport, with a
      great capacity for seeing the &#8220;funny&#8221; side of life&#8212;and
      up or down, financially, he was always the same cheery Van.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Other men got out of their Texas cattle speculations less
      lucky. Dave Garvin, besides losing a lot of his hard-earned money, had to
      take the &#8220;rest cure&#8221; for nearly a year. However, those who
      confined their speculations, within their means, to native-bred cattle
      made money. John Thornburrow, starting from scratch, amassed a small
      fortune. Charley Hutchison, a mere boy, scion of a wealthy&#8217; brewer
      family, sent out here from Ohio to sober up, and put on a section of wild
      land, made a pile of money from his herds</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and more, he became a teetotaler, a solid, honorable
      citizen. Fred Achten, a fifteen dollar a month farm hand, built the
      foundation for the Achten Empire, the largest land holdings in the
      country, largely on cattle and free grass.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, John Rebensdorf, a German farm hand, after
      marrying Christine Zabel and settling down, made plenty of money running
      cattle on free grass. Rebensdorf was oddly a thrifty man. By no means an
      inveterate tippler, he liked, occasionally, to pay for his own beer&#8212;and
      drink it himself. Time and again I have seen him ride into town, tie his
      horse at the rack in the middle of the street in front of the saloon, go
      in, and, elbow himself a place at the bar, order three quart bottles of
      beer&#8212;always three bottles. When he had leisurely emptied the third
      bottle he was ready to pipe. &#8220;I&#8217;ze zee richest man in zee
      whole country.&#8221; And, at that, the man was not far off in his
      calculations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">One time, John Rebensdorf and his brother-in-law, Albert
      Zabel, of German parentage, were engaged in a spirited argument&#8212;on a
      street corner, in my hearing</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">over something which had to do with cattle and free grass,
      Albert, a fine Christian gentleman momentarily suffering a lapse of piety,
      called Rebensdorf all the fighting names in the book&#8212;that is, all
      the names that would rile an American, without perceptibly ruffling him.
      Albert worked himself up Into a white heat, but he couldn&#8217;t bestir
      John. Rebenstorf would say, &#8220;No, Albert, you iss wrong.&#8221; He
      repeated this, meekly, several times. Finally, when Rebensdorf, wearied of
      the argument, started to walk away, Albert yelled parting shot, &#8220;You
      old sauerkraut, you know I&#8217;m right!&#8221; Then &#8220;zee richest
      man in zee whole country&#8221; turned quickly, came blustering back,
      shaking his big fat fist, and roared, &#8220;By gosh, you call me
      sauerkraut! Now I fight!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, the residents would often&#8212;that is, in
      season, cut hay off the prairie that had been more or less grazed. One
      summer my brother Sam and I hauled into town $315.00 Worth, at $2.50 a
      ton, measured in stack&#8212;and much of this was done at night, by
      moonlight, owing to high winds making it impossible to handle the loose
      hay by day. Owners of cows in town, as well as in the country, always
      aimed to have enough hay stored to carry their stock through the winter,
      but often the supply was found to be short, especially when the winters
      were unusually severe. Then the speculators who had stored hay against
      such eventualities, would have an inning&#8212;maybe get $3 or $3.50 a
      ton, in stack. One especially energetic man in the Granada neighborhood,
      with a couple of confederates, put up an unusual amount of this free hay
      one season, inside fire breaks&#8212;then a prairie fire in the late
      winter destroyed all the outstacked hay belonging to his neighbors. Then
      bedlam broke loose among the natives. Still there were no killings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And, even with all that grazing and mowing there was
      enough grass left on the south range to make spectacular prairie fires,
      racing at times, all the way to town&#8212;and would even sometimes jump
      the creek and menace the town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Here is one more of the many incidents attributable to
      the free grass range. Without refrigeration in the early hot summers the
      farmer&#8217;s wives had difficulty keeping butter made from grass-fed
      cows fresh until it could be brought to market. On the whole the women
      managed exceedingly well under trying conditions&#8212;it was before the
      day of screens on the homes&#8212;but there were some that didn&#8217;t
      know how, or just didn&#8217;t seem to care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At that time I was clerking in Than Morris&#8217;
      store, along with Curt Shuemaker, George and Chuck Cawood. We had already
      accumulated a full barrel of off-grade butter that would have to be sold
      for soap-grease, when Morris told us all that should a certain woman bring
      in butter again for us to reject it. It so happened that it fell to the
      lot of the &#8220;cub&#8221; clerk to wait on her. Morris and the three
      other clerks stood by, grinning. I carried her jar into the side room, and
      without uncovering it, brought it back and told the woman we could not buy
      it. She appealed to Than, saying, &#8220;Mr. Cawood here,&#8221; nodding
      toward me, &#8220;took my butter away and got it all dirty, and now says
      he won&#8217;t buy it.&#8221; Morris knew what to look for&#8212;and it
      was there for all to see. He said, &#8220;Look!&#8221; pointing to the
      uncovered jar, &#8220; Cawood didn&#8217;t put those wigglers in your
      butter. Don&#8217;t bring us any more of that stuff.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The woman insisted that &#8220;Mr. Cawood had dirtied
      it up&#8221;&#8212;and Morris paid in full, gross weight. And she was
      permitted to take the whole mess back home, along with her purchases. I
      was thankful that Morris, in dealing with her, also called me Cawood&#8212;minus
      the &#8220;Mister.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Still calling me &#8220;Mr. Cawood,&#8221; this woman
      later told me she had rheumatism&#8212;that she had, unfortunately,
      spilled her cooling bucket in the water well, and that her man would no
      longer allow her to cool her butter in the customary way</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">suspended on a rope deep in the well. After she had
      passed on, the second Mrs. L. made good butter&#8212;so good in fact that
      the town customers called for it by name. But even this could not correct
      the damage done to my delicate stomach during that summer in the Morris
      store. I have never tasted raw butter since that time. And with me, after
      that sheep herding experience, mutton is also taboo. Old Morgan&#8217;s
      sheep were scabby.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Again, while clerking in the Morris store I was put to
      the test&#8212;and though this has nothing whatsoever to do with the free
      grass range, I am sure you will observe that it is neatly wrapped in fast
      green. A Miss Sumerville, a relative of the Zabel&#8217;s, visiting in
      Wetmore&#8212;I believe she was from Pennsylvania&#8212;asked for
      variegated yarn. I told her we didn&#8217;t have that kind, but I would
      show her what we had. I admit that I was not very bright on some matters</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but at that, I wasn&#8217;t as
      dumb as one of the standbys that I could have named.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Morris said, &#8220;Show her what you have in that drawer
      over there,&#8221; indicating the drawer holding the variegated yarn.
      After I had made the sale, Morris complimented me for selling the little
      lady a lot of something she didn&#8217;t want. He said, &#8220;When you
      don&#8217;t have what they want, always try to sell them something else.&#8221;
      He henkie-henkie-henkied in a manner which passed as a derisive laugh.
      &#8220;Keep awake, young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll make
      a salesman in time</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">maybe
      as good as Cawood here,&#8221; indicating Chuck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">With George Cox and his two sons, Bill and young George,
      I helped build that Holland corral earlier mentioned</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and a small bunk house. And it was here where I mixed it
      with the rattlesnake I had been admonished so often to keep a sharp eye
      out for. Note Note how well young America obeyed the injunction. I saw the
      rattlesnake coiled by the roadside as we were coming in after the day&#8217;s
      work, with ox-team, piloted by a Mr. Green who had brought the outfit up
      from Atchison to haul the lumber out from town. I jumped out of the wagon,
      and hit the snake with a rock. It flopped, then lay still. I thought it
      was dead but to make sure I prodded it with a stiff prairie weed&#8212;and
      learned pronto that the stick was a mite too short on one end. That
      rattler lashed out at me, overreaching by the fraction of an inch, with
      its neck or body falling across my wrist. My hands were scratched and blood-stained from handling the rough pine
      boards&#8212;fencing came in the rough in those days</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and Mr. Green insisted that he saw the snake bite me
      &#8220;with my own eyes.&#8221; And to prove it, he spotted a snagged
      place on my hand where he was sure the snake&#8217;s fangs had struck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr. Green crowded those normally slow plodding oxen, and
      we actually came to town by fits and spurts on the gallop. He wanted to
      buy whisky for me, and seemed awfully distressed when I refused it. He was
      so exercised over the matter that one easily could have believed that it
      was he who was in need of a generous slug of the stuff</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and I&#8217;m not so sure that he didn&#8217;t get it.
      Anyway, I was ready to go out on time the next morning. Mr. Green was not.
      And you can bet your life I never again tried to poke a diamondback with a
      stick too short on one end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Incidentally, I may say there were other close calls
      and near misses&#8212;not to overlook the one August day when a
      seven-button, (seven-year-old) rattlesnake actually made a ten-strike on
      my bare foot. And though always to me a bit hazy, I can now assure you
      that this is no dream. Just why I would stand still by the side of the
      hole into which I had poured water in the hope of drowning out a ground
      squirrel, and watch that snake slither up through the grass, coil and
      strike, before going down the hole, has always been something for me to
      ponder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was said in the old days that snakes would charm
      their prey&#8212;mesmerize a bird so that it could not fly away. Well,
      here for once was a &#8220;charmed&#8221; fledgling that did &#8220;fly&#8221;
      away&#8212;too late. The charm was broken the moment the snake struck, and
      though I was only six years old, my brother Charley said I let out a
      terrific yell, and cleared a wagon road in one jump. Even now I wonder
      does one ever get so frightened that both mind and body refuse to
      function?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And here is a solemn truth you will likely find hard to
      believe. For several years thereafter, come August and dogdays, my right
      leg would become spotted like that rattlesnake. In a previous article I
      told of this same rattlesnake encounter, and my Aunt Nancy Porter asked me
      why didn&#8217;t I mention the fact of those recurrent spots? I told her
      that I didn&#8217;t want to weaken the story with anything hard to
      swallow, however true it might be. Then she said, &#8220;Well-I, could
      tell them that it is true, that your mother&#8212;&#8221; her sister&#8212;&#8221;told
      me that it was the gospel truth.&#8221; And there were no better Baptists
      than that pair. Still, in this day of freedom of thought, you can doubt it
      if you wish</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but you would
      be wrong.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">As sequel to the foregoing old-time cattle riding
      story-experienced in my younger days on the gently undulating plains of
      Northeast Kansas, I here record a contrasting up-to-date cattle riding
      experience I recently had on a far away mountain range. But in this last
      ride I did not race my horse and crack my whip for the sheer fun of it&#8212;as
      of yore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Until Sunday, April 18, 1948, I had not been on a horse
      for fifty-five years&#8212;not since the opening of the Cherokee Strip,
      September 16, 1893, at noon, when, with my brother Dave, and Dr. David H.
      Fitzgerald, and Charley Rice, I rode sixteen miles in fifty-six minutes to
      locate a claim on Turkey creek, seven miles southwest of the present city
      of Enid, Oklahoma. In that race we were led&#8212;for a price</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">by &#8220;Ranaky Bill,&#8221; an Oklahoma outlaw.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While going up the mountain, the name of other
      notorious outlaws&#8212;the Daltons&#8212;was mentioned by my nephew, Sam
      Bristow, with whom I was riding. Sam owns &#8220;Dalton Mountain,&#8221;
      some sixty miles east of Fresno, California, where it is said those
      desperadoes were in hiding a long time ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Dalton gang of bank robbers&#8212;following in the
      wake of the Jesse James gang whose hideout was in Missouri</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">operated mainly, I believe, in Kansas and the Indian
      Territory, in the late &#8216;80&#8217;s. At any rate, the Dalton bank
      robbers came to grief at Coffeyville in southern Kansas, with three of the
      gang killed by a sharp-shooting local hardware merchant, and law
      enforcement officers. Grat and Bob Dalton were killed. Emmett Dalton was
      badly shot up</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">was
      captured, convicted, and given a life sentence. President Theodore
      Roosevelt pardoned him. I have a faint recollection that sometime prior to
      the Coffeyville raid, the news dispatches stated that the Daltons&#8212;under
      assumed names&#8212;had shipped their horses to the Far west. And it is
      not at all improbable that our old-time Kansas and Indian Territory band
      of desperadoes rode their horses to the saddle-back near the top of my
      nephew&#8217;s 3500 foot mountain, from which eminence they could have
      guarded the approach in all directions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dalton Mountain is an attraction for patrons of a
      large Dude Ranch close by, in the Kings river area&#8212;something to talk
      about only. No dude could ride a horse up that mountain&#8212;particularly
      none of the thirty New York &#8220;dude&#8221; girls who rode the canyon
      trails thereabout for several weeks, recently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, I recall the time when Jim Dalton, after killing
      Sheriff Charley Batterson and escaping from the Marysville jail, was
      captured by a posse led by Constable Charley Andrews, near the Buening
      school, eight miles southwest of Wetmore&#8212;my home town. After serving
      time, it was said, Jim Dalton went to Los Angeles and made an honorable
      &#8220;killing&#8221; in the manufacture of ovens for bakeries. I do not
      know if he was a member of the old gang. Probably not. But it has often
      been considered that he was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But we were not riding via a series of switchbacks to
      the top of Dalton Mountain especially to view that historic spot. From the
      saddle-back, looking to the north down a tree-studded canyon, and looking
      back over the trail we had traveled, we could see at a glance much of Sam&#8217;s
      1480 acres, of mountain pasture land, trees and rocks. And from this
      lookout we could locate nearly all of his ninety-eight head of cattle that
      had wintered there during the worst winter drought that California has had
      in eighty years, while other valley ranchmen were feeding $40 hay to $100
      cattle, or shipping their stock to pastures in other states&#8212;some to
      the wheat fields of Western Kansas. The north slope of Dalton mountain,
      shielded from the burning sun, is what saved the day for Sam. Campbell
      mountain, almost in Sam&#8217;s dooryard, was picked bare. Sam bought
      fifteen of the cattle taken off that range. In his pasture, those newly
      purchased cattle did not graze with the other stock. And this is where the
      trained McNabb shepherd dog, Spike, comes in. I shall give Spike a line,
      later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Sam was saddling the horses before loading them
      in the truck for the 35 mile drive up into the mountains, from his 80-acre
      valley ranch, his wife&#8212;Anna&#8212;came out to the barnyard, and said
      to me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let Sam talk you into making that hard ride all
      the way up to the top of the mountain. When you get tired, turn around and
      come back.&#8221; Excellent advice&#8212;but that was the one thing I
      couldn&#8217;t do. We were already coming down when I began to tire, and a
      quick reflection on Anna&#8217;s injunction told me that to turn around
      then would have availed me nothing. And though I had had it done to me
      many times in my younger days, that hard four hours horseback ride up the
      mountain and back did not produce the saddle-weary spots my relatives were
      expecting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">For identification purposes, let&#8217;s say Sam&#8217;s
      son Robert, 21-year-old ex-GI, an exemplary young man, and Sam&#8217;s
      daughter Virginia Anne, 13 years old, each own a dog</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">Spike and Curley. When loading the horses into the
      truck both dogs were &#8220;rearing&#8221; to go. Spike, the trained
      cattle dog, told us by signs and in perfectly understandable dog language
      that he wanted to ride in the cab. But he was forced in with the horses&#8212;and
      after he had made the rounds of the pasture, he climbed in with the horses
      without argument for the return trip. In the pasture, the dog would run
      ahead and spot segregated bunches of cattle, then come back, point out the
      stock, and stand &#8220;at attention&#8217;&#8221; awaiting orders. Sam
      said should he tell Spike to &#8220;Go get &#8216;em,&#8221; the dog would
      be off right now. He said it was almost impossible to get the cattle out
      of the hills without a trained dog. Sam paid $50 for the pup, and trained
      it himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sam had said he would not take Virginia Anne&#8217;s
      dog along with us, that Curley would likely pick up a deer trail and
      follow it for hours, which might delay the return trip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">He planned to drive back by the Kings river road through
      the Dude Ranch to show me the place where the new irrigation ditch now
      being put through past his valley ranch</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">to take San Joaquin river water from the lake formed by the
      recently built Friant dam&#8212;goes under the Kings river, ninety feet
      below, through a 27 foot circular cement tube nearly three-eights of a
      mile in length. From the 100 foot bridge spanning the irrigation ditch one
      could look down 90 feet to the bottom of the ditch, and up nearly a 100
      feet to the top of the ridge of dirt deposited by the big dragline. We had
      seen the west approach to this siphon on coming out from Fresno the
      evening before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sam says he frequently sees deer in his pasture&#8212;particularly
      one big buck&#8212;always before the hunting season opens, but never when
      he is permitted to shoot them. With the advancing years, it seems the
      deer, as well as man, are taking on wisdom. Hunters say that as soon as
      the season in California opens the deer make a break for the National
      Parks, where they are protected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sam also said that we would call on Mrs. Bert Elwood,
      who has lived in the canyon adjoining his pasture for a great many years&#8212;and
      get the facts about the Daltons. But she was not at home when we stopped,
      on our way out. I really wanted to obtain from her a firsthand report on
      the early-day cattle business, and information about the cougar menace in
      the low mountains years ago. I have been told that the cougars were
      alarmingly destructive then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The cougars are now mostly in the high mountains,
      though the Fresno Bee reported two killed in the Valley last winter.
      Professional hunters have kept them down in recent years. It is said a
      professional cougar hunter named Bruce&#8212;his surname&#8212;has a pack
      of dogs that will track them down without fail, if the scent is not more
      than 72 hours old. A grown cougar will take a toll of 50 deer in one
      season.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Getting back to the wise deer in the parks. While
      &#8220;doing&#8221; the Sequoia National Park five years ago with Major
      Clement A. Tavares&#8212;he was in the service then, and that &#8220;Major&#8221;
      handle was pretty firmly fixed, but &#8220;Doctor&#8221; takes precedent
      now&#8212;who is the husband of my niece, Alice Bristow, I saw a deer
      browsing about the ranger camp. The Major took a &#8220;movie&#8221; of it
      while it was walking in front of a giant Sequoia tree. A Ranger told me it
      was a &#8220;wild&#8221; deer that had never been in captivity. And I saw
      deer at several places by the roadside so close that I could have almost
      touched them. Also we saw two young bucks &#8220;sparring&#8221; almost
      under the General Grant big tree. The Major turned his camera on them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Again, yesterday, we saw deer in the Yosemite Valley.
      My brother Theodore shooed one away from a foot-path where it was
      nonchalantly nibbling a mushroom. Deer are very tame in the valley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Yosemite Falls, seen at their best on Sunday, May 23,
      1948, with Yosemite creek in flood from melting snow, did not look to be
      2425 feet in height; not until we got up close enough to be sprayed</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">good. Even the foot-path through
      the grove seemed to grow in length, as we walked toward the Falls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Many, many years ago, I heard Eugene May lecture on
      the beauty and immensity of Yosemite Valley at the Methodist Church in
      Wetmore. When it came to describing the Falls, he got up on his toes,
      reached for the sky&#8212;literally soaring up, up, up, in an unbelievable
      manner. Now I find the Falls and other notable sights in the valley all
      that May said they were&#8212;and then some. There are six separate falls
      pouring into the valley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Nothing looks its size up in the High Country. The far
      famed tunnel drive through the big Sequoia tree in the Mariposa Big Tree
      Grove, is deceiving. It looked as if it would be a tight squeeze for the
      car, but after passing through with room to spare, I could easily believe
      a cattle truck might pass through it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While driving in the Grove, with the big trees
      standing surprisingly close together, the Doctor said he had been pretty
      much all over the world, and had seen nothing to compare with this
      wonderful Grove. Just imagine a tree 33 foot through standing 300 feet
      high.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When I first went up into the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
      years ago&#8212;when automobiles were first coming into general use&#8212;trees
      were hitched on behind the cars to hold them back while coming down the
      mountain. And there was a sizable wood-yard at the foothills&#8212;product
      of those drags.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Five years ago, I came down from the Sequoia National
      Park with Major Tavares, when he put the machine in low gear and eased it
      down ever so gently. But now, with everything in California moving along
      in high gear, the tendency is to open &#8216;er up, and let &#8216;er drop
      down at an alarming rate of speed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Last Sunday the Doctor&#8212;yes, it was the Doctor now</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">brought me safely down from the
      Mariposa Big Tree Grove, at a fast clip&#8212;a drop of nearly 8,000 feet
      in 65 miles of winding hairpin curves, done in less than that many
      minutes, the speedometer showing 65 to 70 miles all the way. And I had
      been told that his wife Alice was the best driver in the San Joaquin
      valley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Park roads are really wonderful&#8212;built at the
      right pitch for safety, at every turn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Doctor, with Alice and their two children, Clemie,
      eight, and Myrna, three, plan to fly in June to Honolulu&#8212;the Doctor&#8217;s
      birthplace. He is not Hawaiian, however. Alice has invited me to accompany
      them&#8212;but as I have always believed air travel unsafe, I declined,
      with thanks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But now, after Sunday, I think I would not balk at
      anything&#8212;let come what may.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">Other things may be submerged in the whirlpool of life
      and forgotten, but memory of the old swimming hole, no matter where it
      was, or in what generation, lives long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Now comes a letter from one of the old &#8220;boys&#8221;
      living in another state calling for elaboration of that tanyard gang&#8217;s
      doings. Combining the old swimming hole with the tanyard and our circus
      layout&#8212;they were closely connected</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">he mentions them as likely material for a story. A &#8220;funny&#8221;
      story, he suggests.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Allright, Buddy. You shall have it. But I must warn
      you, Old Pal, that you will, like as not, have the jitters instead of a
      laugh. But you have asked for it. As the desired mirth-provoking story,
      this one will likely be a flop. Buddy must know that while those old
      escapades, incidents, or what-nots, always carry well with the ones who
      have lived them, when transported in word-pictures across the years to a
      new audience, by a limping artist, they very often fail to click.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Halfway convinced that I could still be murdered for
      this thing, I have decided to write a few paragraphs about the old
      swimming hole and the gang&#8212;and some girls. However, I do not falter.
      Going on the theory that when the sweetness of life is over what comes
      after cannot greatly matter, I assume the risk&#8212;deliberately court
      danger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Regardless of the ever-present smell, that tanyard,
      located in a bend of the creek just west of where the town bridge is now,
      was made a sort of rendezvous for all the town boys. A dam was constructed
      across the creek, and there was a Damsite Company, fully officered. The
      pond</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">long, wide, and eight
      feet deep made a fine swimming hole.</span>

      <span class="c0">Michael Norton, a diminutive Irish boy, was our
      life-saver. Shy of qualifications, he was given the post for no good
      reason at all&#8212;unless it was that his willingness greatly exceeded
      his size. Michael was a queer lad. He always crossed himself three times
      before going into the water, and his lips would work in a funny little way
      without saying anything. Furthermore, it was characteristic of the little
      fellow to round out his sentences&#8212;especially when earnestness or
      excitement spurred</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">with,
      &#8220;so I will,&#8221; or with, &#8220;so he did.&#8221; And sometimes

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">This morning I took time to read &#8220;THE OLD*
      SWIMMING HOLE&#8221; which you wrote for the Wetmore Spectator. As usual,
      you are very interesting and your article will be enjoyed by all of the
      citizens of Wetmore and community who lived there in the long ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">It is too bad, John, that you ever quit the paper
      business. It seems to me that you naturally belong to that honorable
      &#8220;tribe.&#8217;* I have laid away your articles as I will enjoy
      reading them again and again. I have often heard it said that it is one of
      the signs of old age when one begins to hark back to our childhood days.
      Maybe so. I am not denying that age i3 probably creeping upon you, but I
      still insist that I &#8220;am as young as I used to be.&#8221; We try to
      keep in touch with the younger generation and to be and become interested
      in the things of today but, in fairness and in strict honesty with
      ourselves, we will have to admit that you and I and others of our age are
      inclined &#8220;to cast our eyes, like a flashing meteor, forward into the
      past.&#8221;</span>

    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Keep it up, John, and when you have anything to

      <span class="c2 c0">At that time the deep slough south of the railroad
      tracks, instead of turning abruptly at Kansas avenue and paralleling that
      street to the creek as it does now, flowed straight across to a point
      fifty yards down stream. The narrow strip of land between slough and creek
      formed the north bank of the old swimming hole. Trees and bramble shut out
      public gaze fairly well, but they did not make a dependable screen against
      prying eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Ten yards farther down stream from the mouth of the
      slough was the old ford. Still farther down stream there was then and is
      now a mammoth elm tree that has budded and shed its leaves sixty times
      since that day. Tramped firm by cow hoofs, and free of weeds, this bit of
      ground marked the spot where our townspeople often went for a few hours
      loll in the shade, and where in the surrounding grove even picnics were
      sometimes held. It was here also where, on one Independence Day, a fine
      English lady from the old Colony essayed to pet a horse on its nether end
      and was kicked in the bread-basket. It was so phrased by our elders then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the old days there was in use in the church a
      hymn-book containing a song entitled &#8220;Beautiful Gates Ajar.&#8221;
      &#8220;Dutch&#8221; Charley Kumbash, with the jarring note of the horse&#8217;s
      vengeance and the lady&#8217;s name fixed in mind, said: &#8220;It wass
      now for her the Peu-ti-ful Kates Achar.&#8221; The lady was a Mrs. Gates,
      daughter of John Radford&#8212;later, Mrs. &#8220;Paddy&#8221; Ryan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Starting from the friendly shade of that great elm,
      where they had gone to while away a little time, and stopping at the old
      ford for a wade in the water, a bevy of girls, wandering aimlessly about,
      fell upon the boys&#8217; domain.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">Willie sent out a low whistle of warning. Eyes from
      all parts of the pond swept the opening down stream. Girls coming&#8212;a
      lot of them, too many to count. The boys ducked. Henry, who chanced to be
      in the top of a small elm tree ready for a dive, found the bottom of the
      pond with his proboscis in no time. One crafty little fellow, well
      plastered with mud, was caught wholly unawares, taking his siesta on the
      bank, cut off from the pond. As one having lost all sense of decency, he
      darted this way and that way in front of the girls&#8212;and then, like an
      ostrich, hid his head in the low forks of a tree, with back exposed to
      company. Well now, maybe it is that the ostrich, when he sticks his head
      in the sand, hopes that he might be taken for another bird. Shall I name
      this ostrich imitator? Well&#8212;maybe later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Let them come!&#8221; yelled Henry Callahan, in
      a braggadocio way. &#8220;Who cares! We used to swim with the Peters girls&#8212;and
      that didn&#8217;t kill us.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; drawled Timothy Doble, in his
      usual draggy voice, &#8220;but remember, we had our pants on then&#8212;and
      that made a lot of difference.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Timothy was so right about this. It certainly did make
      a lot of difference. Incidentally, I may say I have not thought of this
      boy for a long time. And Gaskel was his me&#8212;not Doble. But the boys
      all called him Doble because he was at one time&#8212;a considerable time&#8212;in
      a fair way to have Archibald Doble for a stepfather. However, Bill Kerr,
      young school teacher, stepped in and married the widow Gaskel, who was
      nearly twice his own age. That marriage did not endure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Before going on with the main show, let us go back
      little&#8212;maybe a year, maybe two or three years. This tanyard pool
      brought the swimming hole a mile and a quarter closer to town&#8212;and it
      was hailed with delight by le barefoot boys. Prior to this, the town boys
      did their swimming in the &#8220;prairie pools&#8221; out south. But the
      pools had their bad features&#8212;hazards fraught with disturbing
      elements.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In the first place, one-third of the distance to the
      pools was across the big bottom south of Spring creek which skirts the
      town. The bottom was covered with a rank growth of sloughgrass, and, in
      the early summer months</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">the
      natural time for swimming&#8212;after the grass had burned off,
      needle-pointed stubs were very damaging bare, feet, and caused utterances
      of many an &#8220;ouch&#8221; and not infrequently a &#8220;damnit&#8221;&#8212;and
      this unholy language emanating from youngsters barely past the trundle-bed
      stage. But the little sinners could swim&#8212;every one of them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The prairie pool patronized most, if it were not filled
      with soil, as are all the other pools now, would be close to the public
      road, on the Grant Dale forty acres&#8212;open territory then. Directly
      north of this was the Barney Peters forty-acre isolated prairie farm. We
      could always count being accompanied by one or more of the four Peters</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Bill, George, Jim, and John. And
      on rare occasions two Peters girls, Bertha and Mary, would invade our
      privacy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The pool was about 50 by 25 feet in dimensions with a
      minimum depth of eight feet. It was edged with a sort of &#8220;greasewood&#8221;
      growth of brush which grew in clusters at the water&#8217;s edge three
      feet below the rim. Often water snakes could be seen sunning themselves on
      branches which curved out over the water. It was a most disquieting
      feeling to have one of those four-foot fellows slither across one&#8217;s
      back. They were not poisonous. Still they were snakes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Peters girls did not often come upon the scene. But
      when they did, it was more disturbing than to be raked over the back by
      those snakes. The south side of the pool offered the best place for the
      snakes to sun themselves</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      as soon as the water was agitated by the bathers coming in from the north
      side, as they always did, the snakes would drop off into the water and
      make, blindly, for the opposite side and disappear under the north bank.
      Some of the snakes seemed to sleep more soundly than others, and, on a
      good day, the snake parade to the north side, while not continuous was,
      seemingly, never ended. Were it true, as claimed in the old days, that
      those snakes passing over one&#8217;s back would make hair grow wherever
      they touched the bare skin, I would have more hair on my back than I now
      have on my head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And occasionally a turtle would drop off those bushes
      into the swimming hole. It was said by oldtimers that should a turtle nip
      you that it would not let loose until sundown. Other oldsters said it
      would hang on until it thundered. The adventurous youngsters&#8212;usually
      ready to try anything&#8212;never, to my knowledge, tried to find out
      which way was right. With brassy skies and prolonged summer droughts; with
      thunder clouds few and far between, made it too risky. At that time
      swim-suits were unknown here</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">maybe just not used&#8212;and always after a swim with the
      Peters girls, we would have to walk home in our wet pants.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">That chain of water holes along a three-mile treeless
      water course, was said to have been &#8220;buffalo&#8221; holes. But this
      I was inclined to doubt, after seeing the remains of true buffalo wallows
      in Western Kansas. My Uncle Nick Bristow said there were no buffalo here
      when he came, and that so far as he knew no one before him had seen any.
      But in my time, the whole plains country west of the Blue river was
      swarming with them. They were shamefully slaughtered by eastern outfitted
      crews, for their hides. I believe that Zan Gray</span> <span>&#8217;</span>
      <span class="c0">s novel, &#8220;The Thundering Herd,</span> <span>&#8221;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">was inspired by the big herds of buffalo in
      Southwestern Kansas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then there were the &#8220;second&#8221; pools, a
      longer wash, one mile farther south, fed partly by the Bradford spring,
      which we would patronize in dry times when the stream connecting the
      &#8220;first&#8221; pools would stop running.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back at the tanyard pool: Those girls, full of high
      spirits and gay chatter, scooped up our clothing, such as it was, and
      stood on the bank laughing at us. Save for the one with head so nattily
      ensconced in tree crotch, all were in water up to necks, and thinking some
      rather ugly thoughts, we were, I can assure you, most miserable.
      Miserable, however, does not fully define the plight of the featherless
      bird on the bank.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, holding a yapping little dog to a bulging bosom,
      a Good Samaritan came moving in. Her smiling face was framed in a lovely
      orange bonnet. She interceded for the boys. The girls were adamant,
      heartless. For her pains, the intermediary was called &#8220;Mother
      Fuzzicks&#8221;&#8212;then, and there-after. She was in truth the mother
      of the brave Indian fighter mentioned in an earlier article.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In all fairness to those girls I should say that they
      were, probably, possessed of the idea that their appearance in this manner
      might cure a certain habitue of the water hole of being neglectful of his
      duties at home, and maybe cause him to choose better company as well. They
      could not be censured for that. They were nice girls, those intruders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was our life-saver who undertook to solve the
      problem for us&#8212;the little fellow of multiple peculiarities, the most
      pronounced of which, as you have been informed, was displayed in his
      crossing himself three times before going into the water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I rather think that one, maybe two, of Michael&#8217;s
      older sisters were among that hilarious lot. But as to that I cannot be
      sure. Much water has gone over the dam since that day and on some points
      things are a bit foggy. It is one of the tricks of memory&#8212;that parts
      of a recalled incident will stand out clearly while other parts remain,
      shadowy and tantalizingly, just outside the grasp of the mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">So, then, of those damsels I make no identifications</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">this on account of much fog.
      Still, casting back through the mists of many years, I can sense enough of
      the old thing to cause me to suspect that I could almost spit on one of
      those erstwhile trim maidens, now grown stout, from where I write. Not,
      however, that I would want to do so at this late date.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">With a mischievous twinkle in his pale blue eyes, Michael
      said: &#8220;Lave them to me boys. By-gorry I&#8217;ll show them a trick
      with a hole in it; I will so I will!&#8221; Much stress was laid upon the
      last phrase. It contained the true Irish accent. A trick with a hole in
      it! An old saying, of course</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">much used then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Manifestly, Michael had decided, as any fine boy of
      the period would, to deal modestly with the girls&#8212;or, at least, with
      as much modesty as the exigencies of the situation would permit&#8212;but
      he had reckoned without taking into account the destructive forces of Time
      upon discarded tinware.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Someone, pointing to a stick on the bank, said,
      &#8220;Take that and wallop &#8216;em good!&#8221; It was a portion from
      the butt end of a well seasoned sumac.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Aye, I have it!&#8221; mouthed Michael. At the
      same time he fished out of the mud at the edge of the pond an old
      weather-beaten dishpan, one of many that had been used in the tannery for
      various purposes. This he swung in front of him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, with surprising alacrity and apparent confidence
      in himself and the implement of his veiling, he bounded up the bank,
      pivoting at the top long enough to cast a reassuring look over his
      shoulder to his buddies in the water. The gang beamed approvingly on their
      savior.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Michael advanced on the intruders, shouting in a
      rather thin voice, &#8220;Drop the rags, and scram!&#8221; He waved his
      cudgel. No results. Michael didn&#8217;t like having his efforts go for
      naught that way. The laughter went out of his eyes. His Irish was up. He
      resisted an impulse at belligerence. Then, &#8220;Vamoose, I tell you, or
      bygorry you&#8217;ll be knowing the feel of this shillelagh!&#8221; Now,
      however, his belligerent interest was superseded by new elements.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The girls did not budge. Not then. They laughed
      mightily. All but one. The Good Samaritan shook with suppressed laughter.
      Her orange bonnet bobbed in fine harmony. The little doggie barked. With
      deep concern and echoes of mortification trailing in her voice, the
      laughless one, stepping forward&#8212;it was now observed that she held in
      her hand a shillelagh of her own, once again of magic sumac origin&#8212;exclaimed,
      &#8220;Holy horrors! Look Michael! Your manners! There do be a hole in
      your shield!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">This he took to indicate her desire for him to depart</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">as, indeed, it did. And Michael,
      our defender, &#8220;took water.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">You must believe me now when I say to you that the
      never-to-be-dispensed-with three-time act, peculiarly and persistently the
      boy&#8217;s very own, was delayed somewhat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;You bet!&#8221;</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">January 10, 1936.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, I trust &#8220;Buddy&#8221; will be satisfied
      with the foregoing narration of events at the old swimming hole. He really
      should be. He is in it&#8212;figuring inversely, up to his neck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Since the actual distance from the swimming hole to
      the tanyard was but twenty steps&#8212;and I mean literally steps&#8212;there
      should be no difficulty in making the switch over. Those twenty steps did,
      however, at times, present physical hazards. They were dirt steps carved
      out on a rather steeply inclined bank, up which the tanner&#8217;s sons
      carried water in buckets from pond to tanvat. Barefooted, with pants
      rolled up to our knees, we would dig in with our toes when going up with
      the filled buckets, always spilling a little water on the way, until those
      steps would become a veritable otter&#8217;s slide. As a boy&#8217;s bare
      heels, in the old days, were poorly fashioned for digging in, the water
      carriers would then have to use the longer rope-protected path provided
      for making the descent with the empty buckets. One slippery slide on one&#8217;s
      backside was a hint that it was time to make the switch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But a rehash of the &#8220;circus layout&#8221; as my
      Old Pal puts it, is maybe going to be disappointing, as I can now think of
      nothing in this connection to pin on Buddy. However, I suppose it might
      have been considered&#8212;for recreation purposes only&#8212;as a sort of
      adjunct to the tannery. The trapeze, horizontal bars, and spring-board,
      were only about fifty feet removed from the tanvats. And then, too, the
      lot had the tanyard smell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Ringling Brothers wagon circus had recently made a
      stand here, and the &#8220;fever&#8221; among the local youngsters was
      running high. Activity about the lot was both spirited and awkward, with a
      lively bunch willing to try anything&#8212;once.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The real trouble was, we had only one Star performer.
      Charley Askren was, before he got injured in a fall, a trapeze and bar
      performer with the Dan Rice circus. He was a welcome instructor. And
      though he could still do some wonderful stunts, I think there are none I
      want to mention here, except maybe the time he let me slip through his
      hands in a rather daring act, the fall to the ground breaking my left arm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This statement, without qualification, would hardly do
      justice to my old team-mate. Had we made it, the act would have been a
      honey. And had Charley not said, grandly, to a &#8220;skirted&#8221;
      audience, &#8220;This is going to be good. Keep your eyes pinned on this
      Johnny boy, the G-R-E-A-T and only&#8212;,&#8221; in real circus ballyhoo
      fashion, it might not have been a flop. Charley used a lot of circus terms
      in his work with us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The trouble was, I &#8220;weakened&#8221;&#8212;just a
      wee bit, to be sure&#8212;at the moment when I took the air, and after
      making a complete turn came down also a wee bit tardy for Charley to get a
      firm hold on me, in his head-down swinging position. Had he caught me by
      the wrists, he would have tossed me, on the third swing, face about, back
      to the bar from which I had made the takeoff.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In practice, another boy</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">usually George Foreman, brother of Mrs. L. C. McVay and
      Mrs. R. A. DeForest</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">would
      stand by to right me, in case of a slip. George was tall and very active.
      Sometimes we would change positions in this act. I know now that this
      would have been a grand time for me to have called out, in the usual way,
      &#8220;Let George do it!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sure, we had a well-filled straw-tick which was always
      placed under the weaklings&#8212;but who was there among us that would
      have wanted to have it brought out in the presence of lady visitors? Of
      the two lady spectators, one was a redhead. She fell in love with Charley&#8212;and
      married him. Charley had done a lot of impressive flipping and flopping to
      gain his position on the bar for the act. The redhead&#8217;s younger
      black; haired sister (Anna) was the better looking, and near my age&#8212;but,
      as of the moment, I did not shine as I hoped I might. And then, too, I had
      that broken arm to think about. Dr. Thomas Milam &#8220;splinted&#8221; it
      up drum-tight, according to ancient practice&#8212;but, by midnight, he
      had to do it all over again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, my Dad came onto the lot, and without any
      coaching whatsoever, did some pretty tall kicking. Not the circus kind,
      however. The &#8220;circus&#8221; paraphernalia was then moved up town to
      a vacant spot alongside Than Morris&#8217; corn cribs on the lots west of
      where the Dr. Lapham home now stands. But it was no go. The tannery was
      the natural place for such things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Charley Askren came to us, as a young man, in the early
      70&#8217;s. He was a carpenter. He married Lib Fleming. And
      notwithstanding his serious injury caused by the collapse of a trapeze
      under the Dan Rice bigtop, he lived to be quite an old man. He died at his
      home in Atchison last year. Here&#8217;s hoping that his kid co-performer</span>

      live as long.</span>

      Better Policy</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">NOTE&#8212;Some seventy-five years ago I accidentally
      dropped a five-dollar gold piece into one of the big vats at our old
      tanyard on the creek bank near the town bridge at the foot of Kansas
      Avenue which gold piece was never recovered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The old bridge has now been removed, and a new one&#8212;156-foot
      span&#8212;is being constructed over a newly dug creek channel sixty-five
      yards south of the old one, on a grade ten feet above the old road. In
      building up the grade between the old bridge site and the railroad, Albert
      Tanking, of Seneca, operator of a County bulldozer, today&#8212;June 11,
      1949&#8212;moved the ground where the old tanvats were buried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As he made the excavation I noticed no signs of the
      old sunken vats&#8212;but it is none the less certain that my five-dollar
      gold piece is now deposited somewhere along the west slope of the fill, or
      in the &#8220;sunken garden&#8221; between the fill and the newly cut
      drain-ditch paralleling it. After it rains on the works it is possible
      that I might go down there and pick it up. But I think that I shall leave
      this for the kids to exploit. It was a sort of kid&#8217;s keepsake,
      anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">That five-dollar gold piece was first given me some years
      earlier, in change, by mistake for a nickel. I thought I had been cheated.
      I took it back to Peter Shavey, who had a confectionery store in the old
      part of the building now occupied by Hettie Shuemaker-Kroulik. He praised
      me for being an honest boy&#8212;and he loaded me up with candy and
      oranges. And then he said, &#8220;You know what I&#8217;m going to do? I&#8217;m
      going to give you this gold piece for a keepsake, something to remind you
      always that it pays to be honest.&#8221; And think of it</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">the old Frenchman was illegally selling whiskey and
      unlawfully operating a poker game in the back room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Shavey&#8212;but I still
      have not got my nickel back.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He laughed, &#8220;Here, honest boy, here&#8217;s your
      nickel.&#8221; And now I can&#8217;t be sure If Mr. Peter Shavey inspired
      this noble trait of honesty in me&#8212;or if it just comes natural.</span>

    </h2>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">About twenty years ago, I was going with &#8220;Dutch&#8221;
      Roderick, in his car, to Kansas City, starting at four o&#8217;clock in
      the morning&#8212;and Minnie Cawood, with her two and one-half year old
      Ruthie, were going along as far as Leavenworth. We stopped at the H. P.
      Cawood home, and &#8220;tooted.&#8221; Minnie came out, and Harry
      followed, carrying Ruthie in his arms. She was fussy, and Harry said,
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry&#8212;your partner is out here in the car.&#8221;
      Ruthie said&#8212;well, had she not been such a sweet kid as to call me
      her partner, I&#8217;d be tempted to say she told a &#8220;white&#8221;
      lie, when she said, &#8220;I thought he would be there.&#8221;</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span>T</span> <span class="c2 c0">his, then, is the continuation of the
      story of my father&#8217;s tanyard; with related incidents&#8212;hoarded
      memories of the old days back a half century, and more. They are solemn
      reminders that &#8220;Time flies.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That tanyard was, I might say, a howling success while
      it lasted. Besides the tanyard, my father owned a bunch of boys, and those
      boys, semi-obedient and helpful, really did some commendable things, but
      when encouraged and abetted by the other town boys of that happy,
      care-free age, their doings were not always something to be commended.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Taken by the large&#8212;including, of course, the
      English and the Irish and the &#8220;Dutch,&#8221; and a couple of Swedes</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">they were, I must admit, a
      dare-devil bunch. And I might as well confess now that I was, perhaps, the
      most devilish one of them all. Anyhow, I became a printer&#8217;s &#8220;devil&#8221;
      at an early age.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father made good leather&#8212;and he knew how to
      get the most out of it. Being a shoemaker, he made it up into good boots
      and shoes and gave his boys a good leather dressing whenever they needed
      it&#8212;that is, when their deviltry came within his notice. The Lord
      knows there were hundreds of times when they escaped only by narrow
      margins. And had my father been a little more vigilant, this day of which
      I write promised to be the red-letter day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There were two outstanding events that day, either of
      which would have merited knee-strap activity. In case you don&#8217;t
      know, the shoemaker&#8217;s knee-strap, besides being useful to hold a
      shoe in place while the artisan works, is a persuasive instrument of
      correction when applied with vim and vigor at the right time and place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As already informed, in a previous article, the creek
      had been dammed and there was a fully officered Damsite Company, with
      Michael Norton as life-saver, whose actual services, as Jake Geyer now
      recalls, never amounted to more than his crossing himself three times
      before going into the water. A large wooden box, with metal bottom, used
      for cooking the sumac-tanbark mixture, when not otherwise in use served as
      a boat on that fine body of water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Jim Cardwell, a Kentuckian</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and brother-in-law of Andy Maxwell, the Indian fighter
      mentioned in previous writings&#8212;who held a responsible position as
      coal-heaver at the railroad chutes close to the tanyard, when not
      otherwise engaged, helped the boys occasionally with the work of
      maintaining the dam&#8212;and even helped my father sometimes. All this he
      did out of the goodness of his heart, glad to be helpful. He was a grand
      old sport, even with his one weakness. Jim loved his booze and seemed to
      have a mania for sharing his bottle with others. He even gave Eagle Eye,
      the Indian featured in a preceding story, a nip of his &#8220;firewater&#8221;
      one day, and my father raised Ned about that. It was unlawful to give
      liquor to an Indian.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Having the distinction of being the only enterprise of
      the kind in this part of the West, that tanyard was made a sort of
      port-of-call for all comers&#8212;local and transient.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Lord&#8221; Perry graced the tannery with his
      august presence one day. He was of the old English Colony folk and drunk
      or sober, proclaimed himself a British peer. He was a &#8220;remittance&#8221;
      man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On this occasion, after riding in from his Colony
      home, Perry had stopped up town and was comfortably full when he reached
      the tanyard. He slipped the reins over his horse&#8217;s head and asked me
      to hold the animal while he held audience with Jim Cardwell. &#8220;Hand
      if you let &#8216;er go,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;Hi&#8217;ll cut y&#8217;r
      hears hoff.&#8221; I dropped the reins as soon as he was in &#8220;spirited&#8221;
      conversation with Jim. The &#8220;Lord&#8221; soon forgot about me&#8212;and
      the horse also.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">&#8220;Lord&#8221; Perry had the poise and the marks of
      the gentleman he represented himself to be. Also he loved his drink, and
      indulged himself freely. When he
      had taken on about so much, he would invariably mount a chair, or anything
      handy that he could climb upon, and attempt to make a speech, always
      prefacing his harangue with &#8220;Hi&#8217;m a gentleman hand a scholar,
      by-god-sir, by-gosh!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In this instance, Perry had climbed upon the tank-boat
      which was standing on edge. After making his usual salutory and
      puncturing it with his long arms waving hither and thither, he stood for
      some moments groping for words which did not present themselves with what
      might be called kaleidoscopic rapidity. Then one of the gang&#8212;designated
      here as the one intrusted to &#8216;old the Nobleman&#8217;s &#8216;orse</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">casually leaned against the prop,
      causing it to topple from under the distinguished Englishman.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">His Lordship then lost some of his aristocratic poise and
      a modicum of his temper. A nervous person, with bombastic tendencies, he
      literally exploded when he hit the well-tramped terrain about the tanvats.
      To be accurate, he made a rather awkward display of himself in a furious
      outburst of Anglo-American profanity, in which he branded, correctly, a
      certain member of the gang as a &#8220;Blarsted,</span> <span>&#8217;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">artless hupstart!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Tut, tut, my Lord,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;It
      was an accident.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Haccident, my hye!&#8221; retorted Perry,
      sharply. Jim Cardwell then felt it incumbent upon himself to offer
      something to assuage his Lordship&#8217;s agony, to pour balm upon his
      troubled soul. Good old Jim! How could we have managed without him. He
      once move proffered his bottle. And another drink was directed with grace
      down the Perry gullet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the tanyard there were six vats, each, four by six
      feet, which were set three feet into the ground, with the tops about one
      foot above ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A wild black cherry tree, at this time loaded with
      ripe cherries, stood close to one of those vats. On account of its fruit
      and its fine shade it was the delight of all the boys. Especially was it
      inviting to my little brother Davey Cullom, who, though fourth in point of
      spacings from being the baby or of the home, was still his mother&#8217;s
      darling little curly-headed man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was an erroneous notion that black cherries
      would make one tipsy&#8212;in a mild way. It was also claimed that choke
      cherries, some of which grew in the next bend above oh small trees like
      plum trees, were poisonous. That was erroneous, too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Davey Cullom attempted to walk around on the edge of
      one of those tanvats, and fell in. The vat was filled with strong ooze,
      leachings from the oakbark and sumac. With the process then employed by my
      father it took four months to tan a calfskin&#8212;but Davey Cullom got
      his hide tanned in about fifteen minutes. Not with the ooze, however. It
      was because he could not walk, in a test, the twelve-foot length of a
      ten-inch board without stepping off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Davey told his father that he had eaten too many
      cherries. But the gang knew he was fibbing. Davey Cullom was already
      &#8220;pickled&#8221; when he fell into that tanvat. And had it been any
      place other than the tanyard, my father could have had olfactory evidence
      of his offspring&#8217;s condition&#8212;but in a tanyard, there is but
      one smell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After it was all over but the shouting, Davey&#8217;s
      father shrilled, &#8220;Howl, you pusillanimous little devil, howl! Maybe
      you&#8217;ll now stay out of that cherry tree.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Just at that moment Jim Cardwell came staggering up
      from the creek bank, flourishing his bottle. &#8220;Anybody want a drink?&#8221;
      he queried. My father took the bottle and threw it into the creek. He
      never drank. He was awfully peeved. He swore. And let me say now whatever
      my father did, he did it well. &#8220;Jim,&#8221; he accused, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
      been giving Davey whiskey from your rotten old bottle!&#8221;Davey Cullom
      stopped his howling long enough to say, &#8220;No, daddy, it was the
      cherries; honest it was.&#8221; He supplemented his little lie with the
      further information that it was not the choke cherries, but the black
      cherries, that he had eaten. Then my father said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll cut
      that damned black cherry tree down tomorrow.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jim Cardwell laughed, drunkenly, and inquired, &#8220;Got
      a match, Bill?&#8221; My father didn&#8217;t smoke, and he didn&#8217;t
      have a match. Then Jim mumbled, &#8220;Furnish my own whiskey, find my own
      match.&#8221; He fumbled in his pockets and produced a match.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jim walked over to the curly-headed boy who had lied
      so cleverly, and said, &#8220;Now, Davey, we can show Bill that you didn&#8217;t
      drink any of Jim&#8217;s old rot-gut.&#8221; Placing the match and a
      dollar in Davey&#8217;s hands, he said, &#8220;Bet you that dollar you can&#8217;t
      blow out the match.&#8221; Jim looked at us boys and grinned in a maudlin
      way. &#8220;Light the match and then blow it out, Davey, and the dollar is
      yours. John and all the boys here know you won&#8217;t take a dare; and I
      dare you!&#8221; he taunted. It was then I wished that I could make little
      crosses like Michael Norton to ward off impending disaster.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jim staggered backwards a little as he continued.
      &#8220;But don&#8217;t light the match, Davey, until I get away. I know my
      old whiskey breath will burn like a house afire.&#8221; Davey Cullom
      stared, looked foolish and finally said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want your
      dollar, Mr. Cardwell.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I shall now explain. Speaking for the gang as well as
      myself, we thought Davey would put the stuff to his little lips, then,
      with a wry face, push it away&#8212;perhaps spill it on the ground, which,
      of course, would have tickled us immensely. But the little fellow, feeling
      that he must make sure of winning the dare, took not one but two small
      swigs of the raw stuff. Booze was booze then, and it took only a very
      little of it to make a small boy wobble. If it will help any to put over
      my alibi I will say now that the &#8220;pusillanimous little devil&#8221;
      made that face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now a bright idea struck one of the gang. I believe it
      might have been Will Gill&#8212;now Dr. W. W. Gill, of Enid, Oklahoma. He
      would know, of course. Anyway, someone had said, &#8220;Come Jim, let&#8217;s
      get your bottle.&#8221; They managed somehow to get into the tank-boat and
      they rowed out to deep water. And there, from some unexplained cause, the
      boat capsized. Michael Norton crossed himself three times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then the whole bunch&#8212;lifesaver, officers, and
      all&#8212;plunged into the water without stopping to remove clothing,
      which wouldn&#8217;t have been a very big job, at that. Jim was saved, of
      course. And appreciably sobered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As intimated in the foregoing paragraph, the clothing
      worn by the tanyard gang during the summer months was almost nil&#8212;negligible,
      at any rate. Always there were rents and patches, and more rents. But the
      gang did not care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The next day after Davey&#8217;s debauch my father
      came blustering into the house, and bellowed, &#8220;Now, who in hell has
      taken my axe?&#8221; My mother said to him in her sweet, calm way, &#8220;Oh,
      don&#8217;t be so fussy, William&#8212;Davey loaned your axe to Jim
      Cardwell last night.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Attaching no significance to this fact, nor sensing
      forebodings, my father laughingly said, &#8220;I wonder what Jim thought
      he could do with an axe, in his pickled condition?&#8221; I should like to
      tell you now that he found that out, to his dismay, all too soon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He was a good feeler, was my father, happy as a lark
      when things went right&#8212;and not at all ugly even when he swore, not
      counting of course the tempo of the sulphurous words of easement which he
      sometimes released. Just habitual, understand. The indiscriminate use of
      swearwords was as natural as long-whiskers to the old pioneer. He whistled
      a lot, and sometimes tried to sing, but he was hot very good at that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Having first boots to mend for a patron of his
      shoe-shop, my father was late in reaching the tannery this day. The
      ruffled condition which had broken forth with the axe inquiry now
      relegated from his thoughts, he whistled while he worked, and this too in
      bad taste in the presence of his patron.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It had fallen to my lot to remain at the house for a
      while, the home and the shoeshop being one and the same place. A packing
      case containing alum, tallow, neatsfoot oil, and lampblack, had been
      received by express the day previous. I was to take from this packing box
      some alum, powder it fine, then dissolve it in warm water. It was to be
      used at the tannery in the day&#8217;s workout of the hides from one of
      the vats. It was to firm them. A hide in the jelly stage is as slippery as
      an eel, and it was always a chore to get them safely landed on the work
      bench.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father would work the ooze out of the hides with a
      slicker&#8212;a piece of plate glass ground smooth on the edge. Then he
      would rub the alum in with the same devise, before returning them to the
      vat which would be refilled with fresh ooze. Later, after the six vats
      were worked out, the hides would again be put upon the bench, when tallow
      and neats-foot oil would be worked into them with that same slicker. It
      would come into play again when he polished the blackened leather. All
      handlings at the bench called for vigorous rubbings. So vigorously did he
      attack them that he would sweat. Oh, God, how that man did sweat! Being in
      fine fettle, and late on the job this day, he would rush the work, and
      whistle&#8212;and sweat all the more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Consider now for a moment that cherished black cherry
      tree&#8212;the tree which, in a spasm of idle talk, my father had
      threatened to cut down. It was a large tree, as black cherry trees grow,
      more than a foot through, and tall with good spread. Under this wild
      cherry tree reposed my father&#8217;s work-bench. Also under this tree was
      the ash-hopper in which lye was made from wood-ashes to remove the hair
      from the hides. As a protector from the hot summer sun the tree was well
      nigh indispensable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The sun rose that July morning sixty years ago on a
      rain-soaked world&#8212;a perfumed, growing world; sparkling;
      invigorating. The brook at the tannery, slightly augmented by the early
      morning shower, gave forth a soft, dreamy murmur as it poured over the
      dam. Birds sang sweetly in the tree tops. Jim sang also, though rather
      poorly, as he put the finishing touches on the job to which he had set
      himself. Save for the depressing knowledge that later in the day things
      would sizzle in steaming humidity, with old expansion of noisome tannery
      fumes, all was fine and vely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Came now my father, gayly whistling, to his beloved
      tannery. Davey followed. The other boys were already there. With a puzzled
      look on his face the daddy of that happy-go-lucky bunch stopped suddenly
      in his tracks. He surveyed the surroundings in considerable disgust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At first I thought my father was so overcome by the
      shock that he was not going to say anything. Well, he didn&#8217;t&#8212;exactly.
      Maybe he couldn&#8217;t. But it was none the less certain that a violent
      change of mood had taken place. The thing he saw had stilled his gay
      whistle&#8212;and whereas only a few moments before could his voice but
      have taken up the glad song of his heart he would have sung beautifully,
      now he cursed prodigiously!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And Davey howled some more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That &#8220;damned&#8221; black cherry tree was gone&#8212;cut
      down, trimmed, and neatly piled. Jim had mistaken Davey&#8217;s purpose in
      bringing him the axe. He had done his work well. The morning sun flooded
      the tanvats and the work-bench. By noon it would beat down upon them with
      torrid intensity.</span>

    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c2 c0">The last three preceding articles were done at the
      request of one of the old tanyard-swimming hole gang whom I dubbed &#8220;Buddy.&#8221;
      It really was a triple order. At the same time I was committed to still
      another request. Went out to one of Buddy&#8217;s buddies to verify data
      pertaining to Buddy&#8217;s written request and ran head-on into another
      one&#8212;the one I&#8217;m going to tackle now, together with other
      incidents.</span>

    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is a dangerous operation, this thing of running in
      unrelated episodes, and if in attempting it I should find myself up in the
      air going around in circles with no place to land, I shall have to call on
      Buddy&#8217;s buddy to &#8220;talk&#8221; me down. Though no longer in our
      midst, Buddy&#8217;s octogenarian buddy still lives. And it will be a
      pleasure to grant his request.</span>

    <p class="c23 c27"></p>
    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c2 c0">In reminiscing one incident calls up another, and that
      one still another, and so on ad infinitum&#8212;and anything of the time
      and place is considered fair game, if you can capture it without maiming
      it, or without encumbering something else. In presenting the Strange Case
      of Mr. Henry, I shall try to ease it in without a jarring note. But, to do
      this, I must go back to the &#8220;circus&#8221; lot, grab onto one of my
      co-performers, and work up to it through a chain of co-incidental events.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c23 c27"></p>
    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c2 c0">George Foreman was here at that time going to school,
      and learning telegraphy with his brother-in-law, L. C. (Cass) McVay.
      George was my closest boy friend. After graduating in telegraphy, he
      worked for the railroad company out on the west end of the Central Branch&#8212;and
      later blossomed out as a fullblown lawyer in a finely appointed Denver
      office, all his own. When I called on him there he laughingly remarked,
      &#8220;Here I am, a big lawyer in a big city&#8212;with no clients.&#8221;
      In later years I saw him up at Blackhawk doing assay work for a Colorado
      mining company. This time he aid, &#8220;I&#8217;ve found out that I am a
      better assayer than I ever *was a lawyer.&#8221; He went from there to
      Butte, Montana, still following the assay business. He never married.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c23 c27"></p>
    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c2 c0">His sister, Alice Foreman-McVay, with whom George made
      his home, came here from a highly cultured community over by the river in
      Doniphan county, as the bride of Cass McVay. And, being a refined lady
      with a fine show of modesty, notably out-classing the common herd, got the
      unearned name of being a &#8220;stuck-up.&#8221; But she lived that down
      nicely, simply by carrying on in her own sweet way oblivious to it all.
      Alice McVay had the happy faculty of attending strictly to her own
      knitting&#8212;and letting the world go by. She was, in truth, the town&#8217;s
      most gracious and beloved woman. And had she aspired to it, she could have
      been nominated as the outstanding model of social perfection, displacing
      one who had held that distinction from the town&#8217;s beginning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c23 c27"></p>
    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c0">Up to this time, our people had not been what one might
      call connoisseurs in the art of classifying the townfolk. In the old days,
      social standing was largely measured by wealth</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">even make-believe wealth. For example, Eliza Morris,
      (Mrs. Bill), as the leading merchant&#8217;s wife&#8212;and a big hearted
      woman&#8212;was looked upon as the leader in society, one who set the
      pattern. The fact that she said &#8220;bekase&#8221; for because, with
      many another outmoded expression, did not disqualify her&#8212;but she
      lost caste when she sallied forth to church wearing her new Easter bonnet
      wrong-side-to. But, let it be remembered, she had a way with the
      youngsters about town that was taking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c23 c27"></p>
    <p class="c23">
      <span class="c0">After her husband&#8217;s death, which occurred in the
      eighth year after coming here, Alice McVay could have married, in later
      years, Henry DeForest, the town&#8217;s top eligible bachelor, and while
      she greatly admired him, as did everyone else, she simply would not
      &#8220;desert&#8221; her three children</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">Harvey, Myrtle, and Louis. I was favored with this bit of
      information for having &#8220;tended&#8221; store for Mr. Henry while he
      accompanied the lady with her purchases to her home. Besides teaching me
      double-entry book-keeping of evenings, Mr. Henry would sometimes get
      confidential on other matters. He told me himself that Alice McVay&#8217;s
      love for her children was the one thing which caused her to forego a
      marriage with him. And then too, Mr. Henry was markedly devoted to his
      aristocratic mother, which fact might have had some bearing on what to my
      mind should have developed into a most charming romance. His mother spoke
      of him always as Mr. Henry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c23 c27"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Alice McVay had ample means to rear her children</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and rear them she did right here
      in Wetmore. Then the family moved to Whittier, California. Besides his
      savings, Cass McVay and his brother Bill, had each inherited $7,000 from
      the family estate shortly before Cass died. Alice was a step-sister, and
      also shared in the cut.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Cass McVay was a thrifty man, a real gentleman. Aside
      from his position as station agent at the C. B. U. P. depot&#8212;it was a
      Union Pacific line then, and before that organized as the Atchison and
      Pike&#8217;s Peak railroad&#8212;Cass owned a lumber yard, and operated a
      small grain elevator, powered by a donkey. I know it was a donkey for when
      I would sometimes whip him up in order to lift the grain faster so that I
      might get off early to play, &#8220;one old cat&#8221; with the town boys,
      he would bray just like a donkey. Cass McVay built the dwelling later
      owned by Dr. Guy S. Graham. Close in now, it was considered &#8220;away
      out in the cow country&#8221; then. In marked contrast, Bill McVay
      squandered his inheritance, in drink. He had Spanish blood in his veins,
      along with his other short comings. Bill McVay married Johnny Thomas&#8217;
      oldest sister, Jemima.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The DeForest-McVay romance was not Mr. Henry&#8217;s
      first. That came earlier in life. The girl was the sister of Seth Handley,
      who was Mr. Henry&#8217;s partner in the implement business on first
      coming to Wetmore. Adherence to a family brand of religion</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">something like that which threatened the love of the King
      of England and Wally</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">was
      said to have prevented marriage. She was reputedly a divorcee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In reviewing this romance, I am uncovering no
      skeletons, giving away no secrets. The story has been told and retold, in
      whispers and snatches, with varying degrees of accuracy. Clean and
      beautiful beyond compare, it was not a thing to be hidden under a bushel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I did not get the divorce angle in the case of the
      Handley girl from Mr. Henry, or any other member of his family. Had
      understood all along that it was nothing more than family objections
      occasioned by a doting mother&#8217;s idea of her son&#8217;s superior
      breeding that was holding the romance in check. But John Thomas, one of
      the few oldtimers left, tells me now that he got the impression of the
      divorce from his brother-in-law, Moulton DeForest. So then, I think, much
      as I dislike to, we shall have to accept it as authentic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This causes me to speculate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Henry Clay DeForest was 26 years old when he came here.
      Seth Handley was about the same age. His sister was younger. This would
      have afforded scant time for the girl to have married and become divorced
      before the beginning of her romance with Mr. Henry. And moreover, I cannot
      imagine Mr. Henry deliberately paying court to a divorced woman, knowing
      the while the family feelings, the Church restrictions, and above all his
      aristocratic mother&#8217;s set views on such matters. The romance dated
      back to Madison, Wisconsin, beyond the time he came to Wetmore</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">likely back to school days. And
      in that event, accepting the divorce angle, it very well could have been a
      case where the man had &#8220;Loved and Lost,&#8221; with the old flame
      carrying on after Reno.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The town people said the same thing about Augusta Ann
      DeForest as was wrongfully said about Alice McVay</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and she lived up to it, nobly. I wouldn&#8217;t know
      what, if anything, she had in her own right to justify this, but she had
      the DeForest name to build on&#8212;and that was a million.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The DeForests were of French Huguenot stock. Joseph
      DeForest, grandfather of Mr. Henry, was reputedly, at one time, a very
      wealthy man. He made an endowment to Yale college&#8212;hence the
      schooling there of Moulton and Mr. Henry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Augusta Ann did not play the aristocracy game
      offensively. With courteous dignity, she played it faultlessly. It was
      well known that she had definite ideas about gentlemen in general marrying
      beneath their station and, it was said, she saw to it that her hired girls&#8212;in
      one long-lasting instance an extraordinarily pretty maiden</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">would have no chance, under her roof, to make google
      eyes at her boys.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the process of making, Mr. Henry was not touched
      with this better than thou idea&#8212;and it seems that father Isaac
      Newton had none of it. In fact, Isaac was not at all times in complete
      agreement with his spouse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr. Henry was not Augusta Ann&#8217;s oldest, nor yet her
      youngest. He was seventh in a family of eight boys. Even so, he displayed
      no necromantic talent, despite the ancient superstition. But he sure had a
      lot of the worthwhile kind of talent. Then, too, that run of seven might
      have been broken by the birth of a girl. I never learned just where she
      came in, did not even know of Mrs. John C. Kridler until she came here
      from Denver with her three fine little girls</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">Lettie, Grace, and Blanche. Jane DeForest-Kridler was
      now a divorcee&#8212;something more for the aristocratic Augusta Ann to
      frown upon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Augusta Ann was a mite heavy on her feet, and on her
      infrequent appearances in public leaned heavily upon her Mr. Henry. And
      though not of a mind to recognize caste, our people paid her marked
      respect, and were free in saying that it was mighty nice of Mr. Henry,
      tall and stately, to give his mother, short and dumpy, his arm on all
      occasions. It was truly a most beautiful mother-son attachment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It would, perhaps, be too much to say that in this
      unusual show of attention Mr. Henry had hopes of bringing about a change
      in his mother&#8217;s estimation of his girl. But never doubt he had
      hopes, enduring hopes, that in riding the thing out something favorable
      would turn up. The way I had it in mind, Mr. Henry did not want to break
      with the family&#8212;nor did he have any intention of ever giving up his
      girl. This awkward situation made it inadvisable for him to bring her
      here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One time, after I had gotten myself rather too deeply
      in the mining game for comfort, Mr. Henry told me that he also had, some
      years earlier, taken a flyer in mining with his old partner, Seth Handley,
      at Grass Valley, California. But when the conversation was terminated, I
      was of the opinion that he had, in fact, only put his sweetheart on ice,
      so to speak, for safe keeping against the time when the family winds might
      blow less raw. And had the Aristocratic Augusta Ann have passed on before
      the girl I think Mr. Henry, divorcee or no, would have cast his religion
      to the winds&#8212;as did The King.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Somehow, I don&#8217;t like the divorce angle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Seth Handley&#8217;s sister died at the little mining
      town of Grass Valley, in California, where her brother was a prospector.
      Mr. Henry went to Omaha to meet the Union Pacific train bearing his old
      partner, Seth, and the remains on the way back east for burial. On his
      return home, Mr. Henry was visibly shaken. It was a sad day for him. Few
      people here ever knew just who it was that held such a strangle hold on
      Mr. Henry&#8217;s affections.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">From my early association with Mr. Henry and Seth I
      got the impression that there was more between them than just being
      partners. Later, I had it from one or the other of them, maybe both, that
      the girl in the case was Seth&#8217;s sister. Their implement house and
      yard was just across the street from our home, down by the tracks, on
      &#8220;Smoky Row.&#8221; And though less than half their age, my mother
      said I was always under foot when they wanted to go about their work. The
      year was 1872. But if I were not under foot at the moment when Seth wanted
      to go hunting, he would come to the house and ask me to go along. He would
      shoot anything that could fly. And Seth remembered, years later. He sent
      his respects to me from Omaha by Mr. Henry. At that time I was &#8220;helping
      out&#8221; in the DeForest general store.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I suspect there were some things the aristocratic
      Augusta Ann did not know about her favorite son. While vacationing in
      Colorado Mr. Henry, with the Handley girl&#8212;who was supposed to be in
      California&#8212;rode horses on the trail to the top of Pike&#8217;s Peak.
      Miss Handley rode a sidesaddle, the ancient kind where the lady puts her
      left foot in the stirrup and throws her right leg over the left fork of
      the split pommel&#8212;and holds on for dear life. That was at a time when
      it was considered vulgar for a lady to straddle a horse. Also it was
      before the cog-railroad mounted the Peak, even before the time of the
      carriage road up the north side of the mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Henry&#8217;s eyes sparkled when he told me it was
      a wonderful trip&#8212;one I should not miss&#8212;and though a little
      difficult coming down, especially for the ladies, he said he enjoyed it
      immensely. That was quite understandable. Love had come to Mr. Henry
      wrapped in trouble. Here now for a day at least he was bound by no thongs.
      Here, with the girl who was the most precious one in the world to him, his
      spirits could soar&#8212;unhampered, up to the clouds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Under Mr. Henry&#8217;s oral guidance, I also made
      that trip all by my lonesome&#8212;that is, without my girl. Later, I went
      to the top again with THE Girl, and I can tell you there was a difference.
      We were in love, a maid and a man&#8212;intoxicated with the joy that only
      the first love of the young knows. And the clouds came down to where one
      could almost reach up and touch them&#8212;just as Mr. Henry had said they
      would.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I have learned, as doubtless Mr. Henry had learned,
      that the show spots in this old world of ours take on beauty and meaning
      when you have someone along&#8212;preferably THE ONE&#8212;to help you
      enjoy them. It&#8217;s truly a situation where two hearts can beat as one.
      And it&#8217;s worth a million to see the shine come into her eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might say here that it was while on an editorial
      junket to Colorado Springs&#8212;with THE Girl&#8212;that I made this
      great discovery. It was her first trip to the mountains, and the shine was
      in her eyes&#8212;big. I&#8217;m glad that memory holds the picture of the
      girl, who, in all her radiant loveliness, walked by my side all through
      that week with but one tiny shadow to flit across her faultless blue sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And while she had, with justification, came near
      showing temper one morning, when, in following the crowd, I had innocently
      led her away from the historic grave of Helen Hunt-Jackson, on the
      mountain above the Seven Falls, down the gravel slide, thereby ruining a
      pair of new shoes for her, she was still THE Girl that made all the
      difference. Compared with some of the other women who took the plunge, her
      squawk was mild indeed&#8212;and most ladylike. The well-dressed women in
      that day wore high kid shoes and silk stockings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The gravel slide is&#8212;or was&#8212;about three
      hundred feet downslope from the grave, along the mountain at a left turn,
      where all join hands, stick feet in the gravel, stand erect, pulling first
      one foot up and then the other to avoid being swamped, while the whole
      mass slips away to the canyon several hundred feet below. And there you
      were&#8212;right at the trail, with the laborious climb down the seven
      flights of steps avoided.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The mutilation of those new shoes at a time like that
      was truly a disconcerting thing to befall the &#8220;perfect 34&#8221;
      girl&#8212;we had &#8216;em then&#8212;who had only the day before been
      declared the neatest dressed and most attractive woman in the editorial
      party. She had form, poise, personality&#8212;and a wonderfully good
      dressmaker. However, before the day was done, she evened the score&#8212;and
      gloried in it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Association members held their annual meeting in the
      parlors of the Alamo Hotel that evening, and through the courtesy of my
      good friend, Harvey Hyde, of the Holton Signal, I was nominated and
      elected vice-president. This gesture cost me. Any one of the editorial
      party could have testified that Mr. Harvey had joyously climbed down off
      the &#8220;water wagon&#8221; on his first trip to Oldtown&#8212;Colorado
      City</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">halfway between
      Colorado Springs and Manitou. That I was paying for the whisky without
      participating in the drinking thereof, I cannot deny. But if I should say
      that he never gave me as much as a smell of the stuff, I would not be
      telling the truth. By pre-arrangement, Harvey&#8217;s wife was sharing her
      room with my girl, and I wars sharing my room with Harvey&#8212;and there
      was nothing I could do about it. A bargain was a bargain&#8212;and neither
      of us had the faintest notion of welshing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When the speech-making was getting dangerously close
      to the vice-president&#8217;s turn, I slipped out. Motivated by strictly
      personal interest, Mr. Harvey followed. And though I did, later, get away
      with the acknowledged best write-up of the outing, I couldn&#8217;t have
      said one word in that meeting, with the Pike&#8217;s Peak Press Club in
      attendance, for all of Cheyenne mountain, with the famous Seven Falls and
      the gravel slide thrown in&#8212;and THE Girl knew this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, as it turned out, my girl carried off the
      acknowledged speech-making honors&#8212;following some very fuzzy ones. I
      never could understand why relatively smart people would insist on pushing
      the ill-equipped fellow out into the open. When the call came Major J. F.
      Clough, of the Sabetha Republican, president elect&#8212;the old piker had
      just delegated another to do his talking&#8212;said, &#8220;we must hear
      from the vice-president; someone please fetch him back in.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Major, who, incidentally, in partnership with
      Theodore J. Wolfley, established the Wetmore Spectator, in 1882, and
      therefore was a sort of godfather to my paper, looked over to where THE
      Girl was seated, with Mrs. Hyde and other women including his own
      daughter, Miss Bay. Then THE Girl raised her 118 pounds up to her full 5-6
      height, in her scuffed shoes, saying, mirthfully, &#8220;He has gone out
      with Mr. Hyde. You&#8217;ll not see HIM again tonight.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The applause, started by the ladies&#8212;all of whom
      had scuffed shoes, and instantly taken up by the men, all of whom had
      gotten from their women a neat and not a gentle telling off&#8212;was
      enough to frighten THE Girl. The shine having already gotten back into her
      eyes, THE Girl, in associating me as of the moment with Mr. Harvey, was
      actually trying to cover up for me for running out on them. But the
      inference, nevertheless, pointed toward Oldtown.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There were some in the party who were not bona fide
      editors&#8212;that had worked transportation through the newspapers. A
      Wetmore shoe merchant had made a deal with a county paper. The outing was
      a courtesy gesture of the railroad&#8212;principally the Rock Island.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might say here that the next year&#8212;1892&#8212;the
      Association arranged with the Union Pacific for transportation to Salt
      Lake City, concluding the outing again at Colorado Springs&#8212;and it
      was almost a complete sell-out on the part of the newspapers. We were
      short ticketed to Grand Island, there to meet the through train carrying a
      Company representative who would ask us some questions about our papers,
      and supply us with passes for the round trip. When he came to me, after
      working pretty well through the cars carrying the &#8220;editors,&#8221;
      he laughed and said, &#8220;You are the second newspaperman I have found,
      so far.&#8221; I told him he should find at least one more who knew the
      password. My partner had been coached. Though not present himself, Ewing
      Herbert, of the Hiawatha World, was elected president. And though a mighty
      good newspaperman, he did not seem to have&#8217; influence with the
      railroads. Our Association never got another complimentary outing. But,
      personally, I remained in good standing with the railroads, and got
      everything asked for&#8212;all told about 250,000 miles of free travel. In
      addition THE Girl&#8212;Miss Myrtle Mercer&#8212;had a Missouri Pacific
      pass, and Moulton DeForest, our proofreader, had one for nearly ten years.
      Newspapers do not get them so easily now&#8212;if at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, there were five girls in the Colorado Springs
      editorial party. The secretary, Clyde McManigal, of the Horton Commercial,
      had written the single editors telling them to bring their girls along&#8212;that
      the Association had arranged to have a chaperon look after them. The
      chaperon proved to be a grass widow, a newspaper owner in a nearby town&#8212;and
      right off she found herself a man. The fact that he was a married man, a
      shoe merchant from my home town, by the way, made no difference&#8212;not
      until they got home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Henry had come to the Spectator office, bringing
      copy for a change of his advertisement, and tarried a few minutes to
      converse with me about our Colorado outing. I showed him the proof of my
      write-up. He said he would not take time to read it just then, but he
      marveled at the four fine wood cuts illustrating the Pike&#8217;s Peak
      trip&#8212;and marveled some more when I told him they were engraved right
      there in the office by my brother Sam.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might add that editor Clough said in his paper, the
      Sabetha Republican, &#8220;The Wetmore Spectator has a genius in the
      office in the person of the editor&#8217;s brother, a wood engraver. Last
      week it published engravings of scenery about Pike&#8217;s Peak equal to
      any we have ever seen. They are true to nature and finely executed.&#8221;
      He said, further, &#8220;We also notice that nearly all the papers gave
      the Spectator credit for having the best write-up of the excursion.&#8221;
      Think maybe those engravings had influenced some of the decisions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might say that Sam became so good at it, that John
      Stowell, former owner of the Spectator, sought to get him a job with the
      Government in Washington&#8212;and he came very near doing it too.
      Stowell, an impulsive little Englishman, had the happy thought that as he
      was making his appeal for the boy direct to the Government, that a print
      of a ten-dollar bill would be an impressive sample. It was a lifesize
      masterpiece. Do I need tell you that Sammy&#8217;s Uncle Sam informed them
      that if they didn&#8217;t destroy that cut and all prints immediately,
      somebody would surely get a lasting job? Uncle Sam did, however,
      compliment Sammy on his work&#8212;said it was good, in fact, too good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr Henry also had a few words with Alex Hamel, who,
      besides being the type-setter, was editor-in-chief during my absence.
      Henry said, &#8220;Ecky, I&#8217;ll bet you helped John write that one.&#8221;
      Alex&#8212;he was called Ecky by nearly everyone</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">said truthfully, &#8220;No&#8212;Myrtle did.&#8221;
      But Ecky had slipped in a few sentences about the authoress of &#8220;Ramona,&#8221;
      which bit of history had not appeared to the eye when I viewed the large
      pile of pebbles marking her grave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Being the smarter man, Ecky got the credit for writing
      my best feature stories during our newspaper regime back in the 90&#8217;s.
      But Ecky died in 1899, and I&#8217;ve not been able to find a dependable
      ghost-writer to take his place. However, Ecky did write some really fine
      feature stories for the Spectator, using the pseudonym, &#8220;Xela Lemah&#8221;
      Alex Hamel spelled backwards. And Ecky was a poet, too. The following
      eight lines appeared, unsigned, in my paper, Sept. 1, 1893. It is one of
      many of Hamel&#8217;s poems that were widely copied by other papers and
      credited to the Spectator. To fully appreciate it now, the reader would
      have to know the then generally accepted panacea for bellyache. At that
      time an epidemic of &#8220;summer complaint&#8221; was going the rounds.
      Now, properly signed, this is the only injection of writings by another
      than myself to appear in this volume.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">As against Ecky&#8217;s classic eight lines, my own most
      widely copied writing consisted of only nine simple little</span> <span></span>
      <span class="c2 c0">words&#8212;words well put together, timely, and not
      wholly my own: &#8220;It once rained for forty days and forty nights.&#8221;
      It was a prolonged rainy spring, with farmers kept out of their fields so
      long as to cause much uneasiness. West E. Wilkenson, of the Seneca
      Courier, pronounced these nine words the best piece of writing coming from
      any of his contemporaries in many a day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Brevity&#8212;saying a lot in few words&#8212;did it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I do not mean to brag about this, for the item was
      largely a quotation, as any good Bible student would know. If I really
      wanted to brag, I would tell about the four times in one year my writings
      in the Spectator were selected and reprinted in Arthur Capper&#8217;s
      Topeka Daily Capital&#8212;maybe it was J. K. Hudson&#8217;s Daily then&#8212;as
      the best article of the week appearing in any of the four hundred
      newspapers in Kansas. Selecting and reprinting a best article was a weekly
      feature of the Capital for one year.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I &#8220;crowed&#8221; a little about it then, and P.
      L. Burlingame, a school teacher&#8212;principal of the Wetmore schools in
      the late 80&#8217;s and lawyer thereafter in partnership with his
      brother-in-law, M. DeForest, in offices across the hall from the Spectator
      office&#8212;said that I should have been content to let the other fellow
      &#8220;toot my horn.&#8221; But the Capital&#8217;s readers were not my
      readers&#8212;and I figured nothing was too good for the home folks.
      Always I write for the home folks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Alex Hamel&#8217;s stories were more academically put
      together than anything I could write. Ecky was a school teacher. Also he
      was my very good friend. And it would be ungrateful of me not to
      acknowledge his able assistance</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">though his technique was rather too highbrow for my
      background, and I had to reject many of his literary buildups. Ecky&#8217;s
      writings were clothed in rhetoric and spiced with learned quotations,
      while I had to get along with bare limpy grammar. But then, in newspaper
      writing, it is not always academic learning that counts. However, it doesn&#8217;t
      hurt any&#8212;if one does not try to make it the whole show.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And moreover, one cannot get too much of it&#8212;if
      one learns at the same time to &#8220;carry it like a gentleman.&#8221;
      Firsthand knowledge of the matter one chooses to write about, when
      presented in an interesting and readable manner, even though devoid of the
      earmarks of higher education, always scores high.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">For example, the late Ed. Howe, &#8220;The Sage of
      Potato Hill,&#8221; (his country estate), publisher of Atchison Daily
      Globe, and writer of numerous magazine articles, and a highly acclaimed
      novel, &#8220;The Story of a Country Town,&#8221; once told me that he had
      never studied grammar a day in his life. Like Mark Twain and Damon Runyan
      and Charles Dickens, Howe&#8217;s education really began when he entered
      his father&#8217;s newspaper office at the age of thirteen years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Now, since I have brought the name of this successful
      author into this writing, I would like to tell you a little more about him&#8212;and
      his. Ed. Howe was the father of three noted writers. Jim Howe, now living
      on a ranch in California, was a top overseas correspondent throughout the
      first World War. Gene Howe is publisher of the Amarillo (Texas) Daily
      Globe&#8212;and a magazine writer. And Mateel Howe-Farnham wrote a book.
      Before writing her story, &#8220;Rebellion,&#8221; Mateel&#8217;s father
      advised her to select characters from real life. And this she did. It was
      said in Atchison that Mateel made her father the main character in her
      book; that she was a bit rough in her delineation&#8212;and that she
      painted the picture so well that everyone in Atchison knew without further
      telling. This may be true to a certain extent</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">but I hardly think a dutiful daughter would have gone
      the limit in portraying her father uncharitably. Ed Howe was my friend&#8212;and
      I don&#8217;t hold with those rumors. Doubtless, Mateel padded, and built
      her rebellious character into a personage that did not exist. But her
      &#8220;homey&#8221; line made the story. It was a big success. Mateel&#8217;s
      &#8220;Rebellion&#8221; won the $10,000 Bok prize&#8212;and become a best
      seller.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mateel was living in New York City, while her father
      was in Atchison, Kansas&#8212;and thus widely separated they could not
      compare notes. Ed Howe was asked by Mateel&#8217;s publishers to write a
      foreword to the story. For this he got big pay&#8212;I believe the amount
      he received was fifteen hundred dollars for an equal number of words. I
      think also that the liberality of the publishers was influenced less by
      the Sage&#8217;s fine wording of his contribution than it was by his
      veiled admission that he had been flailed rather unmercifully by his
      daughter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Here, I should maybe pick up a few hanging threads and
      backstitch a little. My entry into the newspaper field was purely
      accidental. Being a chum of the junior partner of Clough &amp; Wolfley,
      who were preparing to launch The Spectator, Theodore Wolfley invited me to
      stick around</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">said I might
      learn something. Mr. Clough, obviously recognizing my need for it,
      observed &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like a newspaper connection to
      bolster your education.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Major Clough had brought along from Sabetha his
      foreman, George Fabrick, to get out the first few issues. Then, after
      Fabrick had gone back to Sabetha, a printer came over from Falls City&#8212;but
      Will Allen played pool most of the time while here. Allen stayed ten
      weeks, went home for a visit, and failed to come back. Then the &#8220;Devil&#8221;
      took over. It was as simple&#8212;and raw&#8212;as that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Spectator passed through several ownerships</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Lawyer F. M. Jeffries, Don Perry,
      John Stowell, Curt and Marie (Polly) Shuemaker. I worked for all the
      separate owners&#8212;but there was a time between Jeffries and Perry that
      publication was suspended for over a year. The newspaper business in small
      towns was not very remunerative in those days. To keep going, the
      publisher often had to take up side lines, but Jeffries rather overdid the
      matter&#8212;and failed, even then. He made a pretense of keeping up his
      law practice, taught the Hayden school, walked three miles out and back,
      and, after a few week&#8217;s help from me, tried to do all the mechanical
      work, with only the help of his inexperienced wife.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The ownership had reverted back to Wolfley, and so
      remained, camouflaged, through the Perry regime, which also was of short
      duration. Perry was a good newspaperman</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">when sober&#8212;having conducted the Seneca
      Courier-Democrat for a number of years. Jake Cober, also of Seneca, was
      his first printer here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">One evening Don Perry came rushing up to the office&#8212;-that
      is, moving as swiftly as he could make the stairs, in his cups, otherwise
      very drunk, saying, &#8220;They are after me</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">I want to make you safe.&#8221; I had drawn no wages,
      and the amount due me was $127.00. He grabbed up a piece of yellow scratch
      paper and penciled a due bill for the amount, and said, &#8220;There now,
      my patient friend, you&#8217;re safe&#8212;that&#8217;s as good as gold,&#8221;
      with emphasis. And the surprising thing is that, though he could not have
      paid cash for another half-pint of booze, that yellow memento, regarded
      worthless, was indeed good as gold. But the payment would have fallen on
      my friend Wolfley&#8212;and that might have complicated matters between
      us. I decided to forget it&#8212;and went to Centralia to work for Bill
      Granger. And The Spectator went into suspension again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, after I had worked as compositor on the Seneca
      Tribune, (with Wolfley again), the Centralia Journal, the Greenleaf
      Sentinel, the Atchison Daily Globe, the Atchison Daily Times, and the
      Kansas City Daily Journal&#8212;subbed for Harvey Hyde&#8212;I became
      owner of the Wetmore Spectator, buying it from Polly Shuemaker after Curt
      Shuemaker&#8217;s death, in December, 1890. And my education, so long
      neglected and retarded by circumstances, had now begun. Let me say here
      and now that I cherish the memory of Theodore J. Wolfley, from whom I
      derived, at an impressionable age, the still unshakable conviction that a
      newspaperman is a pretty good thing to be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Not aiming to brag, I led the &#8220;pack&#8221; on
      the Atchison Daily Times with more type set in given time than any other
      printer. It was back in the 80&#8217;s when everything was handset. On
      learning that a new daily newspaper was to be launched in Atchison, I
      wrote to John N. Reynolds asking for a position as compositor. He replied
      that all cases had been filled. He said he liked the tone of my letter,
      and maybe there would be an opening later. I went down to Atchison anyway
      the day before the first issue was to come out. Reynolds said he wished I
      had applied earlier; that he had been told by a Globe printer&#8212;probably
      Charley Gill or &#8220;Doc&#8221; Tennal&#8212;that I was a swift, printer&#8217;s
      term for a fast type-setter. After a little more conversation, he said,
      &#8220;Come back here tomorrow morning&#8212;if any one of the printers
      fail to show up a 7 o&#8217;clock, you shall have his case.&#8221; A
      printer who had the night before celebrated on the prospect of a new job,
      came in five minutes after I had gone to work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And while I made more money than ever before, setting
      bravier type&#8212;(8-point now) at 30 cents a thousand ems, had I known
      in advance the low character the Times proved to be, I think I should have
      let that disappointed celebrant have his case. Conducting his paper on
      something like iconoclastic order; not exactly image smashing, but
      unquestionably an attacker of shams&#8212;I am now thinking of &#8220;Bran&#8217;s
      Iconoclast,&#8221; published at Waco, Texas, about that time</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">Reynolds dug deeply into the private lives of Atchison&#8217;s
      truly great.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A prominent Atchison banker was reportedly out gunning
      for the editor. The Times office was in a large second floor room on the
      south side of Commercial street. An open stairway, the only entrance to
      the printing office, came up from below in the rear of the building.
      Reynolds, facing the stairway, always with a six-shooter tucked in his
      belt, worked at a flat-top desk halfway between the head of the stairs and
      the printers&#8217; cases against the windows in the front end. It was
      watchful waiting for the eight printers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then one day it happened. When the banker&#8217;s head
      showed above the level of the floor, every printer made a break for cover&#8212;that
      is, got quickly out of range of possible feudal bullets. The banker did
      not come up with his hands in the air. Nor did Reynolds lay aside his gun,
      as he had done a few days before while discussing matters with a woman.
      But then, it was said, the woman had no grievance with the editor. She
      merely wanted to know how he had found out so much about her man and the
      other woman</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">things that would
      be helpful in the matter of obtaining a divorce. And so far as we&#8212;the
      printers</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">were to know, the
      banker might also have had no grievance with the editor. It was apparently
      only a business discussion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As an indication of the stakes Reynolds was playing
      for, I cite this case. A tired, overworked, Commercial street business man&#8212;and
      family man&#8212;was reportedly seen crossing the river bridge with
      another man&#8217;s wife. The incident rated only five lines. Somehow the
      tired merchant got hold of a first copy of the afternoon paper&#8212;and
      it was said, paid $500 to have the objectionable five lines lifted before
      the edition was printed. And I still think Reynolds had engineered matters
      so that the overworked merchant could have a look-see in plenty of time to
      act.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had set that five line item. But I balked, later,
      when I got a &#8220;take&#8221; attacking one of Atchison&#8217;s foremost
      professional men, involving a woman, who, of all women, in her most
      respectable churchy connection, should have been above reproach. I gave
      that &#8220;take&#8221; and my &#8220;string&#8221;&#8212;type set that
      morning&#8212;to a printer whose case was next to mine; and called for my
      time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Nannie Reynolds, the publisher&#8217;s pretty
      18-year-old daughter&#8212;she was really pretty&#8212;gave me a statement
      of the amount due me. Ordinarily, it would have been the foreman&#8217;s
      place to attend to this matter, but, unfortunately, he was in jail&#8212;said
      to have been put there because of his position on the paper, but more
      likely for a night&#8217;s celebration. Oldtime printers thought they had
      to go on periodical &#8220;busts&#8221; to ward off lead poisoning caused
      from handling so much type. And, incidentally, I had declined to take the
      foreman&#8217;s place&#8212;that is, the foremanship of the Times, while
      the ranking man was confined in the City bastile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I took the statement Nannie had given me down stairs
      to Scott Hall, who was to be the cashier of a new bank not yet formally
      opened, in that building&#8212;but he had been paying the paper bills.
      Scott said he had paid out all he was going to until more definite
      arrangements could be made. I went back to Reynolds. He grabbed up a full
      blank newspaper sheet and wrote in six-inch letters diagonally across from
      corner to corner: &#8220;Pay this man $17.65.&#8221; Scott Hall
      reluctantly went into the vault and brought out the money. He said,
      &#8220;This IS THE LAST. You can count yourself lucky in getting away now.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I learned later that the tall Irishman who so bravely
      took my &#8220;string,&#8221; did not profit by it. In fact, there were no
      more payments. And, with the publisher in the penitentiary and a portion
      of his printing plant in the Missouri river, the Times also was no more.
      Atchison&#8217;s enraged &#8220;good&#8221; people did not overlook any
      bets. Reynolds was caught in a Federal net, charged with irregularities
      while president of a defunct Atchison Live Stock Insurance Company.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Reynold&#8217;s wife died a few months after he was
      taken to Leavenworth. He was permitted to come home for the funeral, under
      guard, of course. Nannie had neither brother nor sister. Thus, she was now
      left entirely alone. It is always a very sad thing for a beautiful young
      girl to be left out in a cold world alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While in the pen, Reynolds wrote a book, &#8220;The
      Kansas Hell.&#8221; In fact, he wrote two books&#8212;the other one,
      &#8220;Twin Hells.&#8221; He had been in the pen in another state&#8212;Iowa,
      I believe. After his release from the Kansas penitentiary, John N.
      Reynolds drove into Wetmore with four large gray horses hitched to a
      spring wagon, carrying his books and four male gospel singers. He made a
      stand in front of the old Wetmore House, and sold his books. He spotted me
      in the crowd, nodded a greeting, and later gave me a hearty handshake&#8212;and
      a copy of his Kansas Hell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Like Howe, and Runyan, and Twain&#8212;all good
      newspapermen&#8212;my formal schooling was negligible. I did not work up
      to the big school in Wetmore, on the hilltop. Also, I did not graduate. I
      do do not know if I got as high as the eighth grade, or even far along in
      the grammar school. The one-room, one-teacher school down town had no
      grades. But I do know I wouldn&#8217;t study my grammar. And I now know
      too that this was one regrettable mistake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">If it had not been for the ravenous grasshoppers</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">1874</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and other calamitous visitations upon us in those
      pioneer days it might not have been so, but the fact is, I quit school at
      the age of fourteen to help my father earn money to take care of his
      family while he himself was industriously engaged in bringing in new
      recruits for the school. The tenth one was the only girl&#8212;and to be
      brought up with a bunch of &#8220;roughneck&#8221; boys, she was a pretty
      good kid. And smart too. She studied her grammar in the first school house
      on the hilltop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Nannie and my brother Theodore are, besides myself, all
      there are left of the once big family. They are, and have been for
      forty-five years, living in Fresno, California</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">now at 1005 Ferger avenue. Theodore was the seventh
      son, but contrary to ancient superstition, he has displayed no
      supernatural talent. He is now, and has been for forty years, in the
      employ of the Southern Pacific railroad, at Fresno. Theodore was the last
      born of twins. Willie, the first born&#8212;and sixth in line&#8212;died
      when about a year old. And Joseph, my youngest brother, lived only nine
      months.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Me, I was just a darned good printer&#8212;a &#8220;swift,&#8221;
      if you please&#8212;trying, lamely, to fill an outsize editorial chair.
      And it was Myrtle Mercer&#8212;later my wife&#8212;who, as compositor,
      took the kinks out of my grammar. The hard and fast printer&#8217;s rule
      to &#8220;follow copy if it goes out the window,&#8221; was something to
      be ignored in my office. And though she has been dead now since 1925, that
      ever helpful girl still is, in a manner, taking the kinks out of my
      grammar&#8212;I hope. The pain of shop-acquired grammar is that one never
      knows for sure just how faulty his English might be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Getting back to the dominating character of this
      story, during that morning call at The Spectator office, Mr. Henry stepped
      over to where The Girl was setting type, saying, &#8220;I should know,
      Miss Myrtle, without asking that you must have enjoyed the Peak trip.&#8221;
      Their eyes sparkled as they talked it over. Though months and years had
      passed since the day he made the trip with the Handley girl, Mr. Henry was
      still feeling the exhilaration of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Spectator office was over the W. H. Osborn shoe
      store on a corner across the street from the DeForest mercantile corner.
      Hardly had Mr. Henry gotten back to his store when Myrtle, looking out the
      window, exclaimed, &#8220;My gosh&#8212;the chaperon! Look out below!&#8221;
      Seeing the chaperon heading for the shoe store, caused Myrtle to say to
      me, &#8220;It looks as if some of you brilliant fraters of Faber could
      have foreseen the damage to be done by that foolhardy plunge down the
      gravel slide.&#8221; She had picked up the term, &#8220;fraters of Faber,&#8221;
      in the parlors of the Alamo hotel when the party was welcomed by Mayor
      Sprague, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Pike&#8217;s Peak Press Club.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The shoe merchant&#8217;s wife had taken care of the
      store during his absence, and was still on duty. Somehow, during the hour&#8217;s
      visit, the merchant slipped a pair of new shoes to the chaperon&#8212;as
      was quite proper, since he had led her down that gravel slide. But his
      wife seemingly was not an understanding woman. She followed the chaperon
      to the railroad station, and recovered the shoes. No blows, no hair
      pulling&#8212;not at the depot, anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Another time, while ostensibly vacationing in Colorado&#8212;Colorado
      again, I&#8217;m sure it was&#8212;Mr. Henry had a couple of fine flannel
      shirts washed by a Chinese laundry-man in Grass Valley, California, and
      they had shrunk so badly that he put them back in stock in his store. I&#8217;m
      positive he told me they were laundered in Grass Valley. Those fine shirts
      were to be taken on another outing in Colorado, and one of them got up
      Pike&#8217;s Peak, too&#8212;but those shirts did not find their way to
      Grass Valley this time. I know. I wore them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Years after that sad trip to Omaha, and after he had
      thrown his fortunes in with the younger set, Mr. Henry married a mighty
      fine Wetmore girl, a school teacher&#8212;Miss Anna Gill. The marriage
      license gave their ages as over 21, which was correct as far as it went. A
      closer tab would have revealed his age as being somewhere around 54, and
      hers a full decade above the stated figure. This romance also &#8220;hung
      fire&#8221; for several years. In fact, it was hard to tell just when it
      began.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">More than once have I walked with Mr. Henry the mile
      to her country home, when I thought my friend Alex Hamel, or maybe Rodman
      DeForest, or Johnny Thomas, or my brother Sam, was the top man there. We
      were not, of course&#8212;Mr. Henry and I&#8212;walking out together of a
      Sunday evening to see the same girl, but had I been pressed to make a
      choice of the half dozen girls who congregated there, Miss Anna would have
      been that one. It was not clear to all just who was going to see whom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Alex Hamel&#8217;s most cherished memory of his suit
      was the fact&#8212;so he told me&#8212;that while walking out in the night
      with Mr. Henry and the girl, arms in arms, Alex on one side and the tall
      stately highbred gentleman (Alex&#8217;s description) on the other side,
      he had reached over and kissed Miss Anna. Alex did not say whether or not
      she had inclined her head toward him for the reception of that kiss in the
      dark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was no comedown for the &#8220;highbred gentleman&#8221;
      when he married the harness-maker&#8217;s daughter. Mr. Henry died, in
      retirement, in 1917. His widow and son Carroll, later, moved to Boise,
      Idaho. Augusta Ann DeForest died in 1895. Her husband, Isaac Newton
      DeForest, had died ten years earlier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">During a ten days stay in Los Angeles, following
      Christmas (1947), at the home of my nephew, W. G. Bristow, and his wife
      Ethel, and visiting the Weavers</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">Raymond, Nellie, and Miss Cloy&#8212;Tom DeForest called with a
      new automobile and drove me to his home at Santa Anita, a restricted
      residential section in the foothills, where I met his wife Hilda, his
      daughter Mary, and his son Tommy. He also drove me over to the west side
      to call on the Larzeleres</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Ed,
      Mabel, Ella and her husband Lester Hatch, and their daughter Miss
      Drusilla, who writes feature (society) articles for the Los Angeles Sunday
      Times. Tom, son of Moulton and Mary (Thomas) DeForest, is in possession of
      the original DeForest family bible. From those records, and from Tom
      himself, I verified facts set forth in this article.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Tom DeForest has a $50,000 home only a little way up
      the canyon from the famous Santa Anita race track. After showing me
      through the home and we were on our way out, Tom spied some freshly baked
      pumpkin pies on a table. I imagine they were pies baked for a family
      outing &#8220;below the border&#8221; in Old Mexico, where Tom said they
      were going the following morning for a three-day fishing trip. He said,
      &#8220;I think we ought to have a piece of pie and a glass of milk before
      we go over to Larzelere&#8217;s.&#8221; While eating the pie, Tom
      expounded glibly, as only a DeForest could, on his liking for pumpkin pies
      in general and particularly the one we were eating&#8212;and his
      detestation of the so-called pumpkin pies made from squash. As we were
      going out the door, his wife whispered to me, &#8220;I made that pie out
      of Tom&#8217;s despised squash which he grew himself here in the garden.&#8221;
      Tom has an extra lot back of his residence where he digs in the good earth
      to keep himself fit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">T. M. DeForest is a former Wetmore boy who made good. He
      told me that when he landed in Los Angeles about 1908, Ed (Bogs) Graham,
      another Wetmore boy, staked him to a meal ticket. As we were driving past
      the business location</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">confectionery
      store, I believe</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">of Ed&#8217;s
      twin daughters, Marion and Maxine, very close to the Larzelere home, Tom
      said he had a warm spot in his heart for the girls because of the lift he
      had gotten from their father, long since dead, when things looked pretty
      blue for him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Tom DeForest started his restaurant career with a
      push-cart, peddling hamburgers and beans of evenings, while studying law
      during the day</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">just to please
      his father. The hamburger and bean business grew beyond all expectations&#8212;and
      Tom soon forgot about his father&#8217;s wish that he study law. Tom did
      not travel the streets with his push-cart. He stored it back of a bank
      building in the daytime, and brought it out only of evenings</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">keeping late hours, and quite often &#8220;wee&#8221;
      hours. When he housed the business at 2420 North Broadway, it became
      &#8220;Ptomaine Tommy&#8217;s Place.&#8221; And it continued to grow. The
      name made it famous. Tom told me he could sell the business for $100,000&#8212;but
      he didn&#8217;t know what to do with the money. Then, too, I suspect, the
      complicated income tax demands was also a deterrent. That&#8217;s what has
      stopped Jim Leibig</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">another
      Wetmore boy who has made good, at Santa Ana</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">from turning a big profit. I think Jim could clean up
      with as much, or maybe more, than Tom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Tom DeForest has leased the business to his former help
      for a percentage of the profits. He goes to the place only once every day
      now, (12 o&#8217;clock, noon), to check up</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and gather in the cash. Pretty soft, Tommy&#8212;pretty
      soft.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, was there ever another man like Henry Clay
      DeForest? Certainly not in Wetmore. Mr. Henry was my hero, had been so
      since the time of his partnership here with Seth Handley, when I was
      eleven years old, &#8220;under foot&#8221; much of the time in their
      establishment. And I should have liked very much to have seen his romance
      with Seth&#8217;s sister materialize. Although I had seen her but once, I
      had come to think of her as an exceptionally desirable lady, a lovely
      personage like her wonderful brother Seth. And though it came to naught, I
      still think it was, in a way, the most beautiful romance that I have ever
      known; with the lady waiting&#8212;waiting unto death for the clouds to
      roll by.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And even with the handicap of being influenced by an
      aristocratic mother</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">if it
      really were a handicap</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">Mr.
      Henry rose, in a community dead set against such holdings, to the heights
      in popularity. He was the almost perfect man</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">a man after my own heart, and even now it pleases me
      no little to remember that I had selected him as my hero early in life.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Don&#8217;t be frightened. On paper, smallpox is not
      contagious. That is, usually it isn&#8217;t. But I shall cite one case
      where it might have been. Had you been living here in Wetmore fifty years
      ago, it would have been about a hundred to one chance that you would have
      backed away from the mere mention of smallpox.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Some five hundred others did just that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It was my first and only experience with the loathsome
      disease. Also it was the first</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">and
      last</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">case of smallpox the
      town ever had. There were among us, however, several sorry looking walking
      testimonials of what that pestilence could do to one&#8217;s face. Elva
      Kenoyer, in her twenties, unattached and so remaining to the end, was
      horribly pitted. E. S. Frager, the furniture dealer, got his pits
      elsewhere. Eli Swerdfeger, a retired farmer, had</span> <span>&#8217;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">em all over his face, and deep too. And though he was
      at that time making his living by doing odd jobs about town, he wouldn&#8217;t
      for love or money attend me. Said he had his family to consider.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And Eugene Dorcas, living in the country at the time</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">later in Wetmore&#8212;had
      smallpox so badly that the soles of his feet had come off like a
      rattlesnake sheds its skin. But, at that, he had nothing on me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dr. J. W. Graham, the old family physician, was called
      in&#8212;and, as a mark of courtesy to me, or perhaps more correctly as a
      beginning for launching his son just out of medical school on a like
      career, brought Dr. Guy S. Graham along with him. And, in a manner, it was
      Guy&#8217;s first professional case. They found that I was running a
      temperature of 105, and mighty sick, but no signs or even thought of
      smallpox&#8212;yet. The young doctor remained with me after the old doctor
      had gone to the drugstore to get a prescription filled. He sat on the edge
      of my bed, just visiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At that time, there was a lot of smallpox in Kansas City,
      and I had been there about ten days before with a mixed carload of hogs
      and cattle</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">owned in
      partnership with my brother Theodore&#8212;from my Bancroft farm. Also, I
      had occupied a seat in the railroad coach coming home, with George Fundis.
      He spoke of the prevalence of smallpox in Kansas City, and his fear of
      contracting it&#8212;and then proceeded to have his attack almost at once
      on getting back to his home in Centralia. He might have been a carrier.
      George was a stockbuyer&#8212;but before this time, he owned and operated
      a general store at Ontario.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On the following morning after the Drs. Graham had
      visited me, I noticed red spots deep under the skin in the palms of my
      hands. They worried me. I sent word to Dr. J. W. Graham appraising him of
      my fears, and asked him to not come back. And the young doctor rushed out
      immediately and buried his clothes. However, the old doctor was not
      frightened</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">so he said. But he
      called up the County Health Officer and scared the &#8220;puddin&#8217;</span>
      <span>&#8221;</span> <span class="c2 c0">out of him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had Dr. Graham send for Dr. Charley Howe, of
      Atchison, known as &#8220;The Smallpox Doctor,&#8221; on account of his
      having stamped out an epidemic at Lenora with his vinegar treatment, or
      rather his vinegar preventive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dr. Howe first had a talk with Dr. Graham, and decided
      I did not have it. He came to see me without putting on his rubber suit.
      On first entering the room, however, he said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need
      to tell me anything, you&#8217;ve got it, I can smell it&#8212;but I
      thought you were so scared of catching it, that you would never get it.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">A few weeks before this I had met Dr. Howe at the depot
      in Wetmore, while on his way to Centralia to see a man whom the local
      doctor believed might be coming down with smallpox. I had known Charley
      Howe for a long time</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">had
      worked with him on his brother Ed&#8217;s Daily Globe in Atchison, and
      worked for Charley on his Greenleaf newspaper before he was a doctor. When
      he stepped off the train to tell me about his findings, I hung back a
      little from the start, but when he said the fellow was broken out, I
      backed still farther away from him before he had got around to saying it
      was not smallpox. Dr. Howe laughed about this, and said, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll
      never get it.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The doctor asked me if I had a shotgun? I told him Dad
      had one in the kitchen. He said, &#8220;You better have it brought in
      here. If the people try to force you away to a pest house, stand them off
      with it. To move you now would mean almost sure death.&#8221; Dr. Howe
      told my sister Nannie</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">she
      had been attending me up to this time, and thought she was in for it too&#8212;that
      she could continue waiting on me, without risk, if she would ring off my
      bed with chairs&#8221;, come into the room as little as possible, not
      touch dishes or anything else handled by me, without rubber gloves&#8212;and
      take the vinegar preventive, she would be safe. He said the danger was not
      so much with the first fever stage, as later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The doctor said I should eat no solids; nothing but soft
      food for eight days&#8212;</span> <span>&#8220;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      then,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;you&#8217;ll not care to eat solids or
      anything else, for awhile.&#8221; That&#8217;s when the smallpox patient
      erupts internally. We settled on cream of wheat, and my sister, not
      getting the short term well fixed in mind, kept me on that one diet for
      forty-two days&#8212;long after I was well enough to get out. The County
      Health Officer was afraid to come down from Seneca to release me. He took
      plenty of time, and then without ever seeing me, issued an order for my
      release, with a &#8220;guess so&#8221; attachment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My sister Nannie, at seventeen, was rather plump</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">not bulky fat&#8212;but after the
      vinegar treatment she came out as slim as a race horse, and has been trim
      ever since. An awful lot of cider</span> <span>vinegar</span> <span
      class="c0">&#8212;it had to be cider vinegar</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">was consumed in Wetmore that winter. I believe the
      vinegar produced an acid blood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On the first afternoon when the fever was making me
      pretty stupid, I had spent maybe a half hour sitting by the stove in Bud
      Means&#8217; store, below the printing office. Near by, there was a water
      bucket, with dipper, for everybody&#8217;s use. I did not drink at the
      public bucket that day</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      when it became known that I had a high fever at that very time, and was
      now down with smallpox, it was but natural for Bud to imagine that I had
      tried to cool my fever with several trips to his water bucket. And there
      was no imagination about the quaff he himself had taken from that dipper,
      after I had left. Bud told me after I had gotten out&#8212;not right away,
      you can bet your life&#8212;that it almost made him sick.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With Elva&#8217;s and Eli&#8217;s pockmarked faces
      constantly in mind, I laid awake nights to make sure that I would not, in
      my sleep, scratch my face, or misplace the slipperyelm poultice, done in
      cheesecloth, in which my face was swathed. And then, even then, it was
      awful, a mass of apparently disfigurating open pustules, with face redder
      than a spanked baby.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After my face had come back to somewhere near normal, I
      sent my neighbor, Ed Reitzel, up to B.</span> <span>O.</span> <span
      class="c2 c0"> Bass&#8217; barber shop to buy&#8212;not borrow&#8212;a
      razor and mug, aiming to use them only once. Then, before I had started on
      that oh-so-awful looking face, I began to wonder if maybe Byron had not
      sent me his &#8220;deadman&#8217;s&#8221; razor, and I had to send Ed back
      to make sure about that. I knew that Byron, when telling one of his funny
      barbershop stories, was liable to do and say things off key. One time he
      poured nearly a whole bottle of hairoil on my head&#8212;which I had not
      ordered, and didn&#8217;t want&#8212;while he was looking away from his
      work, and laughing at his own funny story. Then I had to have a shampoo
      before I could go to &#8220;protracted&#8221; meeting that night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Fixed up with Byron&#8217;s razor, I looked a little
      more like myself, and was now ready to hold an appointment with my girl,
      who was also the manager of my newspaper business, with the alternate help
      of Herb Wait and Jim Harvey Hyde, of the Centralia Journal. She had
      secured for me from General Passenger Agent Barker in St. Louis a pass
      over the MK&amp;T railroad, to Galveston. George Cawood had sent me word
      not to show up at his store for awhile after I would get out, and I knew
      that all the town people were feeling the same way about me. Hence the
      trip to the gulf.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As instructed, Myrtle met me at the front gate of her
      home, handed me my credentials and the money she had gotten for me, stood
      off a reasonable distance, also as per instructions, and said, &#8220;You
      look like the devil.&#8221; The cold had enhanced the &#8220;splendor&#8221;
      of the blemishes on my face. If she could have said further, &#8220;But I
      still love you in the same old way,&#8221; it would have been a more
      cheerful sendoff for the long journey ahead of me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But Myrtle was too busy trying to tell me how she had
      managed my business. She didn&#8217;t know it, but she herself had, in
      prospect, a substantial interest in the printery. Before leaving the
      office on that dreadful day when my fever was at high pitch&#8212;I mean
      actual temperature&#8212;I deposited in my desk a check written in her
      favor, with no ifs or ands attached, for an amount which would have come
      near bankrupting me as of the moment&#8212;even as I have now, since I am
      no longer a family man, set aside the residue of my possessions, if any,
      in favor of the sister who had so bravely, at the risk of her face and
      figure, stood by me through that smallpox ordeal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After getting settled in bed that first night, I told
      my sister about the check in my desk, and also told her that I wanted her
      to see that it be paid, if, and when, it would appear appropriate to do
      so. I was remembering at the time the case of Myran Ash and Ella
      Wolverton, south of town. Ella had waited on him in his last sickness, and
      in the meantime picked up Myran&#8217;s check for $1,000. His relatives
      tried, but failed, to prevent her from cashing the check.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When I boarded the train at Wetmore that same day,
      Charley Fletcher, the conductor, coming down the aisle gathering tickets,
      stopped stock-still, and backed up a few steps, when he saw me. He wouldn&#8217;t
      touch my Mo. Pacific pass until I had explained that it had been in the
      office all the time during my sickness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After first calling on my doctor, I stopped in
      Atchison long enough to buy a suit of clothes and other needed articles. I
      had left home wearing an old suit, &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from Ed Murray.
      On leaving the clothing store I met, or came near meeting, Mr. Redford,
      bookkeeper at the Green-leaf-Baker grain elevator, whom I knew quite well,
      having shipped grain to the firm. Taking to the street, he shied around
      me, but he had the decency to laugh about it&#8212;and told me that I
      would see Frank Crowell, of the firm, at Galveston, if I were going that
      way. The Kansas Grain Dealers Association was to hold a meeting in
      Galveston two days hence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On my way to a barbershop down the street, I had a
      chat with my doctor again. He was standing on the sidewalk at the bottom
      of the steps leading up to his office, grinning. He said, &#8220;Well,
      your conductor came along while I was standing here, and I asked him what
      did he mean by bringing that smallpox patient down from Wetmore?&#8221;
      Dr. Howe laughed, and said, &#8220;You know, I thought that poor fellow
      was going to collapse on the sidewalk, and I had to tell him quickly that
      you couldn&#8217;t give it to anyone if you would try.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was one small spot on my jaw that had not
      properly healed, and I had asked the doctor earlier, in the office, if he
      thought it might cause the barber to ask questions? He said, &#8220;No, no&#8212;just
      go in and say nothing.&#8221; But after we had talked awhile on the
      sidewalk, he said, &#8220;You better hunt a fire before you go to the
      barbershop. Your face is as spotted as a leopard.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At Galveston, I met Mrs. Poynter&#8212;she was our
      Bancroft correspondent&#8212;with several of the grainmen&#8217;s wives.
      Usually very sociable, she acted as if she were looking for a chance to
      run, and I backed out of a rather embarrassing position. Evidently not
      knowing of my smallpox siege, Secretary E. J. Smiley gave me a cordial
      ham, even laughed as if he were remembering the illegal grain contract
      which he and my local competitor had virtually forced upon me, &#8220;for
      benefit of the Association&#8221;</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">a similar one of like illegality, which had, reputedly,
      within a few weeks therefrom, got someone a 30-day jail sentence at
      Salina. Other acquaintances in the grain dealers party acted as if they
      could get along very well without me&#8212;and I troubled them no more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back home, the people gradually stopped their shying,
      and in the week I waited for the County Health Officer&#8217;s
      instructions for fumigating the house, I talked matters over with the
      family. For the peace of mind of our town people, it was decided that
      everything in the smallpox house should be burned&#8212;and my parents and
      my sister would go to Fresno, California, where my brothers Dave and Frank
      were in business.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My Aunt Nancy, with her husband, Bill Porter, drove in
      from their Wolfley creek home, and had dinner with the folks the day I was
      to start the fires. Bill Porter said it would be rank foolishness for us
      to burn the stuff. I said, &#8220;All right, Bill; drive by this afternoon
      and I&#8217;ll load your wagon.&#8221; He said, quickly, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
      want any of the things</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">on
      account of our neighbors.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Several years later, the Porter family all had smallpox&#8212;and
      Bill, the elder, died of it. And Bill, the second</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">there is a third Bill Porter, and a fourth Bill Porter
      now</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">tells me that not for
      six months thereafter did they have callers. Had I loaded his wagon that
      day of my fire, the loss of my uncle would have made it regrettable&#8212;but
      I don&#8217;t think that I would have allowed him to cart away anything,
      even had he accepted my offer.</span>

      <span class="c0">Jessie Bryant&#8217;s three-months old daughter, Violet,
      was first in the Porter family to have it, and she was thought to have
      contracted the disease in a rather peculiar way. Jessie was holding the
      baby on her lap as she read a letter from her husband, Lon Bryant, who was
      working in</span> <span></span> <span class="c0">Nebraska, saying he would
      have to move from the place he was staying, on account of the people</span>
      <span>in</span> <span class="c2 c0">the home having smallpox.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The burning of the things was mostly done that
      afternoon, but the fumigation would carry over into the next day. To avoid
      an extra scrubbing of myself, with change of clothing twice, I planned to
      stay that night in the house, and held back one bed and some bedding. It
      was in the same room I had occupied, and was first to be fumigated. It
      would get another dose of brimstone the next day, after the room would be
      cleared. I opened all windows and one outer door, but the room did not air
      out readily. The brimstone had penetrated the bed covers so as to make
      them squeak under touch, and I could hardly get my breath in the room. It
      was almost dark, and quite cold. I could not sit by an open window,
      through the night. Then I thought of a roll of linoleum in the kitchen. I
      put one end of the rolled linoleum in the bed and stuck the other end out
      the window. With the coat I had worn that day wrapped around my neck, I
      got in bed, covered up head and foot, stuck my face in the funnel, chinked
      around with the old coat, and got through the night very well&#8212;with
      little sleep, however.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our close neighbors did not show undue fright. In
      fact, they volunteered assistance while the home was under quarantine&#8212;but
      they had the good sense to limit their visits to the middle of the road in
      front of the house. My brother Sam got out before the red flag was posted,
      and took refuge in his mobile photo gallery. My father got caught, with my
      mother, in the kitchen&#8212;and remained there and in a connecting
      bedroom until permitted by the proper authorities to go to his shoeshop.
      And there, save for one lone kid, he had no callers, for the duration&#8212;but,
      with the help of this boy runner he kept the supply line open to the
      quarantined house. Louie Gibbons, half-brother of &#8220;Spike&#8221;
      Wilson, our old Spectator&#8217;s celebrated &#8220;Devil,&#8221; after
      spending forty years in Minneapolis, Minnesota, got the urge to see what
      Wetmore and Holton looks like now&#8212;and, after flying to Kansas City,
      dropped in here for a day recently. When he found out who I was, and I
      learned who he was, he said, &#8220;You know, I used to carry groceries
      over to your home in the east part of town when you had smallpox.&#8221;</span>

      persons of dubious ways and stupendous blunders, should not miss the
      climax in this last paragraph. After I had cleaned myself up with doubly

      class="c0">which, by the way, salivated me</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">I called on our neighbors, Don and Cass Rising. Don had
      been choreboy for the folks while holed up. My face was not pitted, and
      Don said that I must have had smallpox very lightly, or maybe not at all.
      I told him I had protected my face because I figured that it would be
      about all I would have left after the expense of the thing&#8212;but if he
      would send his wife out of the room, I would show him. My hips, and even
      farther back all the way round, were badly pitted</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">still very red, almost raw. When I showed him, Don
      yelled, &#8220;Cass, Cass&#8212;come in here!&#8221; I started to pull my
      pants up, but he grabbed hold of my garment, saying, &#8220;No, no</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">don&#8217;t!&#8221; Then he

    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Starting out with the grain trade in Wetmore, I will
      say Michael Worthy had been a shipper before I got into the business. He
      owned and operated a small grain elevator connected with the flour mill
      originally built by Merritt &amp; Gettys, and later owned by Doug Bailey,
      G. A. Russell, and Littleton M. Wells, on the south side of the railroad.
      After the mill and elevator were destroyed by fire in the eighties, Mr.
      Worthy built a small combined crib and grain house, with a long high
      driveway, on the location of the present Continental Grain Company&#8217;s
      elevator, west of the depot, north of the tracks. There had been a minor
      accident on that high driveway, and Mr. Worthy had abandoned use of it.
      This reduced him to the status of a track buyer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the meantime I had bought the Grant Means corn crib&#8212;capacity
      ten thousand bushels&#8212;on the north side of the tracks, east of the
      depot, and filled it with ear-corn, for speculation. When I moved that
      corn, I saved some money by shipping it myself. And that&#8217;s how I got
      into the grain business, as a side line, in competition with Mr. Worthy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">About this time, the Kansas Grain Dealers Association
      was born. The Association did not recognize track buyers. In fact, its
      members fought them whenever they came in competition with the elevators.
      Just how my competitor, with his inoperative dump, got into the
      Association in the first place was, of course, his own business. I didn&#8217;t
      care to join the Association&#8212;probably couldn&#8217;t have got in
      anyway, as I had no blind dump.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But I was shipping to a house in Atchison that had
      been forced into the Association to hold its business. I think Mr. Baker
      had come in only on one foot, however. Anyway, he was sending me sealed
      bids, and buying my corn against an Association rule which said he must
      not do that. It took Mr. Worthy nigh onto two years to find this out. And
      then, of course, it was his duty to report the matter to the Association.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had a friend in the Mo. Pacific Agent, and whenever
      I would bill out a car of corn, Ed Murray would give me the waybill which
      ordinarily would have been placed in a box by the door on the outside of
      the depot for the trainman to pick up along with the car. I watched for
      trains, and in event the car had not been taken out, I would put the
      waybill in the box after I was sure Michael would not snoop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr. Worthy was a devout Methodist, a religiously just man
      who would not knowingly do a wrong&#8212;a wrong according to his lights.
      He attended prayer meeting every Thursday night. His home was a half mile
      south of town. On a Thursday I had two loaded cars on track. That Michael
      had something unusual on his mind this day there could be no doubt. He had
      stopped by to chat a bit with me while the cars were being loaded. He
      handled coal in connection with his lumber business, owned coal-bins close
      by, and had the grace to putter around them a bit before leaving the
      scene. I hung around on the fringe of the depot that night</span> <span>until Mr. Worthy drove by, as always, in his one-horse
      buggy, with lantern hanging on the dashboard. I allowed time for him to
      drive to his home, and a little extra&#8212;then dropped my waybills in
      the box. And that was the night when I should have stood vigil until the
      wee hours.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Michael snooped. Two A. M.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the fifth morning after that shipment I got a
      telegram from Atchison telling me, much as a friend might ask a criminal
      to come in and give himself up, to go to the Josephine hotel in Holton
      that day and join the Grain Dealers Association.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, there was a circus billed for Holton that day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I found Michael Worthy and Secretary E. J. Smiley at
      the hotel waiting for me. There was much stir about the hotel, as if a
      general meeting was in progress. Mr. Smiley told me that he and Mr. Worthy
      had a tentative contract drafted, and that I might take my girl to the
      circus&#8212;then I was to drop by the hotel and sign up for membership in
      the Association, which would cost me $12 a year, in quarterly payments. I
      was going to take my girl to the circus anyway. Harvey Lynn and Anna
      Bates, and Myrtle Mercer, were in the hotel parlor waiting for me. We had
      planned this even before I got that telegram. I had complimentary tickets,
      and we could not afford to miss the circus to parley over a contract. We
      four circus lovers had gone to Holton with a livery team, in an open
      spring wagon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After the circus, Mr. Smiley asked me if I had any
      objections to the contract? I told him that inasmuch as I was being pushed
      in with scant knowledge of what it was all about, and that in deference to
      my friends in Atchison who were urging me to get in PDQ, that I would sign
      on the dotted line&#8212;and trust to luck. It seemed to be Mr. Worthy&#8217;s
      field day, and he would have had his own way, anyhow. It looked as if it
      might rain, and I did not want to waste time quibbling over the matter. If
      need be, I would gladly forego shipping altogether for the life of the
      contract&#8212;which was six months, with renewal privilege</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">rather than get my friends in trouble.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When I had signed the paper, Mr. Smiley shook his
      head, negatively, grinned, and said in undertone so that Michael couldn&#8217;t
      hear, &#8220;He&#8217;ll not want to renew it.&#8221; I pondered this for
      many days, and don&#8217;t know that I ever did hit upon the right
      solution. There certainly was nothing in the contract to alert me on that
      point. Had Mr. Smiley known what I had decided to do in the matter before
      I got home that day, he would have been justified in making that
      prediction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, it rained. It rained &#8220;pitchforks.&#8221;
      And, in that open wagon, there were two mighty sloppy girls, and as many
      sloppy boys&#8212;and, to make matters worse, the creek was over the
      Netawaka bridge. Held up here, I took the opportunity to scrutinize the
      $3.00 package I had so recently purchased, practically &#8220;sight
      unseen,&#8221; and see what they had really done to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The contract gave Mr. Worthy two-thirds of the
      business, and I was to have the other third. If either of us got more than
      the allotted proportion, he must pay the other one cent a bushel for the
      excess. We would buy now at a price supplied us from day to day by an
      anonymous somebody having no permanent address. No matter where located,
      any member receiving house that we might choose, would confirm our sales.
      It was September, and the old corn was about all gone. Mr. Worthy had 1200
      bushels contracted from Herb Wessel, and I had 3000 bushels coming in from
      Charley Hannah. By agreement, these lots were not to be counted on the
      contract.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Harvey Lynn was Assistant Cashier of the Wetmore State
      Bank, and should have been able to decipher any funny business&#8212;but
      he could see no just reason why Mr. Worthy should be given twice as much
      as me. Certainly not on account of that old dump.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Anna Bates said, &#8220;Why, that old dump, nobody
      would risk their horses on that rickety high driveway. I&#8217;ve heard
      lots of farmers say they wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; Mr. and Mrs. O. Bates were
      operating the north side restaurant, and as waitress Anna had a good
      opportunity to hear the corn haulers express themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle Mercer said, &#8220;I know what I&#8217;d do.
      You could let Mr. Worthy have it all, and then go down to his lumber
      office once a month, and collect. That would give you a third interest in
      his grain business&#8212;just for grapes. That ought to hold him.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Harvey said, &#8220;John, I believe Myrtle&#8217;s got
      something there. You can&#8217;t fight with your hands tied.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;But,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that clause saying I
      must buy everything offered, at a designated price, will keep my hands
      tied.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle said, &#8220;Think, think, think! Let&#8217;s
      pray that there shall be a way around that. It&#8217;s not fair to let Mr.
      Worthy do all the thinking. It&#8217;s only for corn shipped. And you
      always fill your cribs every winter anyway.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">She was all for the grapes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">As of the moment, Myrtle&#8217;s estimate of one-third
      was correct</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but, like a
      struggling corporation doubling its capital with the induction of new
      blood, our new set-up raised the buyer&#8217;s margin from one cent to two
      cents a bushel; thus reducing the little man&#8217;s share to one-sixth of
      the gross, with all the expense of handling and shipper&#8217;s losses
      falling on the promoter. And the losses&#8212;mostly on account of wet
      snow-ridden corn being carelessly scooped off the ground into the sheller&#8212;were
      unusually heavy that winter. But Michael, being the man he was, took his
      medicine without a whimper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Happily, there was a way around it. An honorable way.
      Michael said as much himself. Actually, I did not ship one car of corn in
      the whole six months. But I did spring the market on nearly all the 10,000
      bushels of ear-corn cribbed that winter. My crib was 16-foot tall on the
      high side, with doors or openings well up toward the top, and it took more
      to get the farmers to bring it to me in the ear. The extra money paid for
      the shoveling was very generously interpreted by Mr. Worthy as no
      violation of our contract.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Though I was the loser, a funny incident fits in here. I
      was bothered some by petty stealing, but never a loss of any consequence.
      John Irving, commonly called &#8220;Nigger John,&#8221; head of the only
      colored family ever living in Wet-more&#8212;and, except John, a right
      good colored family it was</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">thought
      it a huge joke on me. He laughed &#8220;fit to kill&#8221; when he told me
      that he had climbed up to one of those high doors one night about 10 o&#8217;clock,
      and then dropped down on the inside to the corn, and was filling his sack,
      &#8220;when I gets me some company.&#8221; He said a white man, (naming
      him) with sack in readiness, had dropped down on top of him. He laughed,
      &#8220;That white man, he was sure scared most to def.&#8221; Nigger John
      also told me that he and our deputy town marshal had bumped heads in my
      corn crib one dark night. &#8220;But that&#8217;s eber time,&#8221; he
      lied. And John was not what you might call a really bad Nigger. Other men
      who helped themselves to my corn were not &#8220;white&#8221; enough to
      tell me about it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, someone had whittled out a hand-opening,
      enlarged the crack between two boards on the back side of the crib&#8212;with
      a loss of two or three bushels of corn. When I went down one evening about
      dusk to close the crib, I saw a very fine old lady&#8212;a grandmother&#8212;filling
      her apron with my corn. I sneaked away, praying that she had not seen me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And again, I had given permission to a crippled man to
      gather up some shattered corn around the sheller after the day&#8217;s
      run. When I went down late in the evening to close the crib, I saw the man
      and his wife putting ear-corn in a sack. I didn&#8217;t want to</span>
      <span>humiliate</span> <span class="c2 c0">them, so I walked unobserved
      around to the opposite side of the crib, and made a lot of racket. The
      sacks contained no ear-corn when I got around to the sheller&#8212;and I
      knew then that they would always be my friends.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Eighty-three dollars was the largest monthly check
      paid me on that lop-sided contract. With the sixth and last month&#8217;s
      collection in hand, I asked Mr. Worthy if he wished to renew the contract?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Lord no,&#8221; he said, throwing up his hands.
      &#8220;The nice thing about this track buying is, when a fellow knows he&#8217;s
      licked, he can shoulder his scoop-shovel, go home and sleep soundly.&#8221;</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But it was not so tough on Mr. Worthy as one might think.
      We had been buying on a one-cent margin. Now we</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">or more properly he</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">were working on a two-cent margin, and, barring shipping
      expenses and losses, he would still be making a cent profit on the third
      on which he would have to pay me one cent a bushel. It was just galling
      him</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">that&#8217;s all. He
      had the old-fashioned notion that one should labor for his money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Worthy told me later that he had made the
      discovery of my billing at two o&#8217;clock that night after he had gone
      home from church. He laughed, saying he had made several futile nocturnal
      visits to that box before this time. It was luck more than perseverance
      that had rewarded him at that late hour. A freight train that would have
      picked up the loads, had it not already been loaded to capacity, passed
      through at 11 o&#8217;clock. Also, he said he had believed for awhile that
      I was selling my corn on the Kansas City market&#8212;and that when I
      would get enough of this that I would quit. Except on a sustained rising
      market, the dealer shipping to Kansas City could not compete successfully
      with the dealer who sold to the receiving houses, on advance bids. And
      that is how the Association was eliminating the track buyers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I could not realize at first what tremendous advantage
      this lop-sided contract would give me. On the face of the contract&#8212;no.
      Decidedly the opposite. Nor was it out in the open for Michael to see. In
      fact, it was by way of developments mothered by that contract. The
      Association maintained a weighmaster at all member receiving houses, who
      would check on member-shipper&#8217;s receipts, at 35 cents a car, if
      desired; but it was not obligatory. Having had some rather unsatisfactory
      treatment from other houses, I had now found a place where I could depend
      on getting honest weights. I wrote F. M. Baker, telling him that while I
      hardly knew yet why the urgency, I had paid for a membership in the
      Association; and, as I had always had satisfactory weights from his firm,
      I desired him to disregard the Association weighmaster.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He wrote me, saying he deeply appreciated my statement
      of confidence in him; that he had been accused of all manner of
      uncomplimentary things&#8212;stated much stronger&#8212;and that if he
      could ever do me a favor, he would do it gladly. Thus was laid the
      foundation for a real helpful friendship&#8212;but, handicapped by that
      lop-sided contract, it did not come into being for another six months.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the q~t, we belonged to the same poker club.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When I got a free hand, I also got the corn. We
      received bids from the purchasing houses every morning, good until 9:30
      a.m. Corn bought after this time would be subject to the fluctuations of
      the day&#8217;s market, with a new bid the next morning. Though I hardly
      know how it got started, it became a fixed routine for the firm&#8217;s
      telegraph operator and buyer, George Wolf&#8212;now Executive Vice
      President of the Exchange National Bank, in Atchison&#8212;to call me up
      after the close of the market. If I had bought corn that day on the basis
      of the morning bid, and it had dropped a cent, or any amount, he would
      book it at the morning bid. And if it had gone up he would tell me to hold
      it for developments the next day. Sometimes the market would go up day
      after day, and I would not sell until there was a break; and then I would
      get the last top bid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That was grapes&#8212;ripened on friendship&#8217;s
      vine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I spent a pleasant hour with George Wolf in his
      private corner of the Exchange National, three years ago. We discussed old
      times. I believe George would now vouch for all I am saying here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I went down to Atchison one afternoon, when corn had
      dropped a half cent. I had 3,000 bushels that I had bought from Jim Smith,
      and 10,000 bushels of the Ham Lynn corn which I had agreed to ship for his
      account, at $5 a car. The corn was several years old, and a portion of the
      big crib had been unroofed for one whole summer. The grade was doubtful. I
      did not want to buy it outright. There was a car shortage, too, and I
      wanted the shipment to take care of the grades as well as penalties, if
      any, in case the shipment was not completed within the 10-day time limit.
      Mr. Baker said he would take my 3,000 bushels at the morning bid, and Mr.
      Lynn&#8217;s 10,000 bushels at the present market (one-half cent less) if
      he would let it go at that. And in that case he would give me credit for
      the half cent, amounting to $50. He said, rather gruffly, &#8220;We don&#8217;t
      owe the farmer anything. There&#8217;s the phone. See what you can do with
      him.&#8221; Mr. Lynn accepted the new offer. And he was mighty glad that
      he did. By the time I got around to telling him all about the deal, corn
      had dropped several cents. If it had gone up, I don&#8217;t believe I
      would have ever told him. The Lynn shipment totaled 13,000 bushels, with
      only one car off grade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I used to take an occasional flyer on the Board of
      Trade&#8212;mostly, I believe, before my good Christian friend, Albert
      Zabel, told me that it was gambling. I had 7,000 bushels of corn cribbed,
      and Albert had 3,000 bushels cribbed on the same lots, which he wanted me
      to sell. Corn was cheap then, and getting lower as the new crop promised a
      good yield. A good general rain the night before had spurred our desire to
      sell at once. My top bid that morning was 17 cents.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Ed Murray, agent at the depot, showed me a wire from
      the Orthwine people in East St. Louis, bidding Mike Worthy 18% cents. I
      had shipped some corn to the Orthwines. I wired them, offering 10,000
      bushels at 18 3/4 cents, same as their bid to Mr. Worthy. Their reply was
      slow in coming, and I may say that when it did come, the market was off
      nearly five cents.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had told Albert that evidently the Orthwine people
      were waiting for the market to open&#8212;and that I was going to sell
      mine on the Board, and asked him if I should include his in my sale? He
      studied a moment, then said, &#8220;That would be gambling, wouldn&#8217;t
      it?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;No&#8212;not when we have the corn to
      fill the contract. This will be protection against further loss. We
      gambled, Albert, when we bought the corn at the ridiculously low price of
      eleven to sixteen cents a bushel.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Albert said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. If
      it wasn&#8217;t for them weevil in the corn, I would hold it over until
      next year.&#8221; We had previously discussed this, and decided that it
      would not be advisable to hold it over. He finally said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;ll
      not go in with you. I never gamble.&#8221; And just think of it, the
      fellow was buying and shipping hogs&#8212;continuing in the business until
      his finances were &#8220;not what they used to be.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I sold 10,000 bushels anyway, on the Chicago Board</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and cleaned up three cents a
      bushel by the time we sold our cribbed corn at 14 cents a bushel. &#8220;Them&#8221;
      weevil had us scared. But the damage was not enough to lower the grade
      beyond the number three contracted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the old days, many of the farmers would shuck their
      corn early, pile it out in the open on a grass patch or rocky knoll, and
      then haul it to market after it had taken rains and snows&#8212;the more,
      seemingly, the better. More than once have I gone out to the country, and
      shoveled drifted snow away for lots bought on contract. It was such corn
      as this that brought the weevil, which worked mostly in the damp spots.
      Another trick of the old farmer was to wait for a freeze before shelling
      and marketing his ground &#8220;cribbed&#8221; corn. One such car of mine,
      billed for &#8220;export,&#8221; and passed by the Greenleaf-Baker firm&#8212;that
      is, not unloaded in Atchison, was reported steaming when it arrived in
      Galveston. It had passed inspection in Atchison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Think I should say here&#8212;well, really it should
      be apparent without saying&#8212;that our reputable farmers were not
      guilty of this practice. It was usually floater-tenants, irresponsible
      farmers making a short stay in the community, who devoted much time to
      figuring out a way to skin someone. A fellow by the name of Groves,
      farming the old Adam Swerdfeger place eight miles northwest of Wetmore,
      contracted to deliver to me 800 bushels of &#8220;Number Three, or better&#8221;
      corn at 32 cents a bushel. When the wagons began coming, in the afternoon,
      I saw the corn was not up to grade, and I held up the haulers waiting for
      the arrival of the seller. In the meantime I learned from the haulers that
      it was corn that had been frosted, gathered while immature, shelled while
      frozen, and stored in a bin on the farm. The fellow had sent word by the
      last hauler in, that there would be two more loads to follow. When they
      did not show up at the proper interval, I dumped the loads (in waiting)
      and let the impatient farmers go home. I knew now from the way the fellow
      was holding back that I would have a tough customer to deal with&#8212;but
      I would take a chance on him. I felt that I couldn&#8217;t afford to keep
      the haulers, who were my friends, waiting longer. The seller came in with
      the two loads between sundown and dark. I told him the corn was not up to
      grade. He said,&#8221;Well, you&#8217;ve dumped it, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
      I said, &#8220;Yes, for a fact, I have dumped thirteen loads of it&#8212;but
      here&#8217;s two loads I&#8217;m not going to dump.&#8221; But I did
      finally dump them, on agreement with the fellow to ship the lot separately
      and give him full returns. The shipment was reported &#8220;no grade&#8221;
      and the price was cut six cents a bushel. I paid the man 26 cents a
      bushel, on the basis of our weight&#8212;and was glad to be rid of him.
      Then, the next day I received an amended report on the car. It was found
      to be in such bad condition that the receiving house had called for a
      re-inspection&#8212;and the price was cut another eight cents a bushel.
      And this was mine&#8212;all mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It seemed to me that nearly everything, in the old
      days was, in a sense, touched with that horrible word&#8212;gamble. And I
      know that I really did gamble in an attempt to grow a crop of corn on my
      expensively tiled bottom seed-corn farm down the creek a mile from town,
      one very dry year.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I hired all the work done, paid out $500 in good money&#8212;and
      got nothing but fodder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Another time I filled my cribs with 25 cent corn and
      held it for the summer market. When I was bid 49% cents a bushel, I
      jokingly told Mr. Worthy that I couldn&#8217;t figure fractions very well,
      and that I would wait for even money. Fifty cents was considered a high
      price for corn then&#8212;but usually when it would reach near that
      figure, the holders would begin to talk one dollar corn. It was a year
      when the corn speculators just didn&#8217;t know what to do, after the
      price began to slip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Alpheus Kempton, over north of Netawaka near the
      Indian reservation, had 5,000 bushels stored on the farm. He told me he
      had been watching my cribs, and thought that maybe I had inside
      information of a come-back in prospect. I too had been watching some
      cribs, with similar thoughts. The Greenleaf-Baker firm had 20,000 bushels
      stored in two long cribs at Farmington. As I frequently traveled the
      railroad&#8212;on a pass&#8212;and noticed the corn had not been moved
      out, I thought that maybe, after all, I had not erred in letting the high
      bids get away from me. I told Mr. Baker that I had been watching his
      Farmington cribs for a reminder as to when it would be time for me to sell
      mine. He laughed, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve sold it (on the Board) and
      bought it back probably twenty times.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, Alpheus and I&#8212;we held our corn over
      another year&#8212;and then sold it for 301/2 cents a bushel. May I say
      that by this time I had brushed up on my arithmetic. And Christian or no,
      who is there to say I did not gamble that time? I still maintain that I
      gambled when I bought the corn. However, there were times when I sold
      25-cent corn for 70 cents&#8212;and most of it went back to the country
      here. The only advantage that I could see in storing corn instead of
      buying it on the Board, was the possibility of striking a local market.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And again, I bought 5,000 bushels of wheat on the
      Chicago Board, at 61 cents a bushel, and margined it with $100. As the
      market advanced, I bought seven more five thousand bushel lots with the
      profits, making 40,000 bushels in all. It was a very dry time in Kansas,
      and wheat was jumping three to five cents a day&#8212;and had reached a
      fraction under $1.00 on the Thursday before Memorial Day, which of course
      would be a holiday, with no market.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My profit on the single $100 investment was now nearly
      $4,000.00. I had planned to get out before the close of the market on
      Thursday, because I did not want to run the risk of carrying the deal over
      the holiday. But the weather map, just in from Kansas City, indicated
      clear skies for Kansas over the week-end. This, coupled with the exuberant
      spirits of the excited dealers on the Atchison Board, caused me to change
      my mind. One more day of dry weather would likely double my earnings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The weather man was wrong; horribly wrong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It began raining in Wetmore about 10 o&#8217;clock
      that night. You&#8217;ve probably been lulled to sleep by rain patter on
      the roof. Believe me, there was no lullaby sleep in the constant rain
      patter on the roof over me that night. It rained off and on here all day
      Friday. Everyone I met on the street here exclaimed, &#8220;Fine rain,
      John!&#8221; I would say, &#8220;Yep&#8221;&#8212;and think something
      else. It was truly a $4,000.00 rain, in reverse&#8212;so far as I was
      concerned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On Saturday morning, the speculators were back on the
      Atchison Board of Trade floor&#8212;to a man. The rain had washed their
      faces clean of all animation. Mr. Roper, working with telegraph
      instrument, rose and faced the weary-laden boys. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221;
      he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got good news</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">for nobody.&#8221; The death-like quiet for a fraction of a
      moment, as if we were standing in the Salt Lake Mormon tabernacle waiting
      for the usual pin-dropping demonstration, gave way to a concerted sigh. It
      had rained everywhere.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I sold 50,000 bushels at the opening. My profits were
      wiped out clean. The extra 10,000 bushels short sale made me $63.75 in
      about three minutes. And this, added to the return of my $100&#8212;and
      relief from liability&#8212;made me feel rich.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Though little or no wheat was grown here at that time,
      the Kansas wheat farmer was considered the biggest gambler of them all.
      Even so, having just got out of a big wheat deal, by &#8220;the skin of my
      teeth,&#8221; would it not be good business for me to take a &#8220;flyer&#8221;
      in some wheat land, and try growing the stuff?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Land in the wheat country was going begging at $300 a
      quarter&#8212;the same land that is now selling up to $200 an acre. Land
      agents were actually fighting over prospective buyers. Bill Talley, born
      in Indiana and reared here, was at this time operating a drink emporium in
      Wetmore, but had lived, and dealt in land, at Cimarron, in Gray County. At
      the depot, the day I started for the west, Bill told me to go to his
      friend, Johnny Harper. When I got off the train at Cimarron at 2 o&#8217;clock
      at night, Johnny was there to meet me. We by-passed the leading hotel&#8212;a
      rival agent, F. M. Luther, lived at the hotel&#8212;and Johnny took me to
      a restaurant three blocks away. The next morning Johnny and his partner,
      Mr. Emery, ate breakfast with me at the restaurant. Mr. Emery was to drive
      me across the river to look at land. Every parcel of land shown was priced
      at $300 a quarter. And at every booster stop we visited, the farmer would
      reply to Mr. Emery&#8217;s inquiry: &#8220;I would not take $25 an acre
      for mine.&#8221; A few sandhill plums, a dilapidated barn, and
      weather-beaten three-room house&#8212;made the difference. We got back to
      Cimarron about four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As if he were sure I had seen a plenty to interest me
      on the side of a quick purchase, Johnny produced a map, saying, &#8220;Now,
      which piece have you decided on?&#8221; I had made no decision. Mr. Emery
      then thought I might like to see a big alfalfa field four miles up the
      river&#8212;not that it was for sale, but just to show me how good it was.
      In truth, it was just to get me out of town. The alfalfa looked good, but
      you know my mind was fixed on wheat, and this big field did not interest
      me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had company again for supper, and either Mr. Emery
      or Mr. Harper stayed by me until bedtime. It was Saturday. I needed a
      shave. Mr. Emery took me through the main business part of the town to a
      barbershop on the south side of the tracks. And here I came as near
      getting a skinning as I ever did in a business deal. There were, of
      course, better shops in town&#8212;but competitive real estate agents didn&#8217;t
      go across the tracks for their shaves. In the meantime Mr. Luther had
      dropped in at the restaurant. He was introduced by Mr. Harper. I asked Mr.
      Luther if he were engaged in business in Cimarron? He replied, &#8220;Yes,
      the real estate business.&#8221; Right away I had a notion that I should
      like to have a private talk with Mr. Luther. Likewise, Mr. Luther. And don&#8217;t
      think that Johnny didn&#8217;t catch on, too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Luther bid us &#8220;good night,&#8221; and
      stepped outside. Mr. Harper bid me &#8220;good night,&#8221; and started
      on his way out&#8212;and I went up to my room. We were to start right
      after breakfast on a drive to Dodge City, thirty miles down the river,
      where I would get a train for home. I did not go to bed immediately. I
      went back downstairs for something, I don&#8217;t remember what now. Maybe
      to pick up a little disinterested information from the restaurant man. Mr.
      Luther came back in at the front door. Mr. Harper followed immediately. I
      went back up to my room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The following morning three real estate men ate
      breakfast with me. Mr. Harper, Mr. Emery, and I started for the livery
      stable a block away, while Mr. Luther lingered awhile over his coffee.
      Bill Talley&#8217;s friends owned their driving team, and did their own
      stable work. When they got their fractious horses partly hitched, I made
      an excuse to run back to the restaurant. Mr. Luther said, &#8220;You were
      over in the neighborhood of the Kelly school house yesterday, I believe. I
      can sell you three quarters in the same section as the Kelly school house
      for $200 a quarter, or $600 for the three quarters.&#8221; I promised to
      write him&#8212;or see him later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Emery drove me to Dodge City, showing me a big
      30-acre cottonwood planting on the way, which purportedly was the reason
      for the drive. It did not interest me. We had cottonwoods at home. Mr.
      Emery stabled his foaming horses at a livery barn on the south side of the
      tracks, near the river, a good quarter of a mile from the Santa Fe depot.
      We ate our dinner at a restaurant close by the depot. It was Sunday. Mr.
      Emery showed me the town. We visited &#8220;Boot Hill&#8221; Cemetery, the
      only visible reminder now that Dodge City was once the wildest and
      toughest spot in the Old West, and other semi-interesting and some
      non-interesting places. After walking our legs off, we were now near the
      depot again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Emery wished to look in on his erstwhile steaming
      horses. Yes, I would go along with him. On passing the depot I dropped out
      of the line of march on the pretense of wanting to get a line on the
      through train I was to take that evening. This done, I hiked back to the
      restaurant, inquired for a real estate office, and was told the Painter
      Brothers in office above the restaurant were the men I should see. A poker
      game was in full swing, but one of the brothers&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t for
      the life of me remember which one now&#8212;took time out to tell me that
      he could sell me land as good as the best for $200 a quarter. He gave me
      some literature. We planned to meet again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I rushed back to the depot in time to meet Mr. Emery
      on his return from the stable. We walked some more. A local train from the
      west was due at 3 o&#8217;clock. Johnny Harper got off this train&#8212;and
      took over. Mr. Emery bid me &#8220;good-by&#8221; saying he would now
      drive his team back to Cimarron. Johnny proposed a walk. We took in the
      town again&#8212;always by our lonesome. He saw me off on the train. I did
      not learn how Johnny planned to get back to Cimarron. And I didn&#8217;t
      care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Bill Talley was at the depot when I got back home. He
      said, &#8220;Well, did you see Johnny Harper? Fine fellow, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
      And, &#8220;Did you find anything to suit you?&#8221; Yes, I had seen
      Johnny; fine fellow, too. No, I had not bought anything&#8212;yet. But I
      planned to buy three quarters in the same section as the Kelly school
      house, from F. M. Luther, for $600. Bill popped his fist in the palm of
      his left hand, and bellowed, &#8220;Damn Luther!&#8221;&#8212;with
      shocking prefix.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is only fair for me to say that ordinarily Bill was
      not given to the use of such language. But the exigencies of the situation
      were very much out of the ordinary. With prospect of a cut in commission&#8212;and
      his fear that I might run afoul of Mr. Luther&#8212;Bill had gambled the
      price of a telegram to Johnny Harper. I did not learn the why of this
      explosion for a little over one year. My brother Frank was considering a
      trade for a quarter of irrigated land south of the river, two miles from
      Lakin, and had written from Fresno, California, asking me to look it over,
      and report to him. On going through on the train, I stepped off at
      Cimarron, and inquired for Johnny Harper. A by-stander said Johnny was not
      among the people on the station platform&#8212;but, he said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s
      his brother.&#8221; Johnny&#8217;s brother stepped forward, saying he was
      going west on the train. On the train, he said, &#8220;You were out here
      last year driving with Johnny. Why didn&#8217;t you buy, then?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I told Johnny&#8217;s brother that they had &#8220;herded&#8221;
      me so closely as to make me suspicious. He said they had to do that to
      keep their competitors from blocking their sales. He said the competitors
      would quote a low price on tracts in the neighborhood of the places
      visited by Johnny&#8217;s prospects&#8212;and then, if the prospect
      decided to buy, the competitor would discover that his partner had just
      sold it to another&#8212;but he always had other bargains to show him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Johnny&#8217;s brother also told me that our friend
      Talley had gotten into an altercation with Mr. Luther, and that the
      Cimarron man had knocked the whey out of our Wetmore boy&#8212;all while
      the latter was connected in the realty business with brother Johnny.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">If I could have gone out there wholly on my own&#8212;that
      is, without any helpful interference from Mr. Talley, and maybe got lost
      on the big flat beyond the sandhills just south of the river for a week, I
      could have made a potful of money. I had planned to buy two sections. But,
      instead, I bought 80 acres of rather swampy bottom land here for the same
      money, $2400</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and then
      spent $1800 more to install five miles of drain tile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This tiling was a gamble that paid big dividends.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Michael Worthy, my late semi-partner in the grain
      business, had better luck than I. He bought Gray County wheat land in the
      neighborhood of the Kelly school house</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">which was to be passed down as a huge profit-making legacy&#8212;even
      to the third generation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Oscar Porter was a track buyer at Bancroft until Jim
      Wilcox, elevator owner, crowded him out. Being a track shipper, Oscar was
      not eligible to come into the Association</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">nor was I, but somehow I had been roped in. Porter
      wanted to know how I did it, that he might do likewise. I could give him
      no helpful information. His next step was to start legal action to compel
      me to divulge the secret. I was subpoenaed to appear in court&#8212;supposed
      to be the star witness&#8212;in a complaint lodged by Mr. Porter against
      the Association.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">County Attorney S. K. Woodworth called me aside, said he
      knew I had the information to smash the Association, if I would just give.
      He said I could tell the truth&#8212;he added, &#8220;and I know you will,&#8221;
      without fear of having it used against me. I asked him if he were thinking
      of the time when I had slightly stretched the truth&#8212;but I really had
      not done this</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">in behalf of
      his candidacy, in my newspaper? He laughed at that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I told Sam that he could depend on me to answer his
      questions truthfully, as always&#8212;he laughed again&#8212;but that I
      would not make a statement. He said he would not ask me to do that. I was
      not particularly in sympathy with the Association, but I did not want to
      volunteer information against it&#8212;and then, too, my Atchison friends
      and my partner Michael were entitled to some consideration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I answered the County Attorney&#8217;s questions
      truthfully, and I believe satisfactorily&#8212;but still they did not get
      what they wanted. I had the information, of course, but Sam and Oscar knew
      too little about the business in hand to formulate the right questions. I
      believe they did not know about that illegal contract.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">If they could have had Michael and our illegal
      contract, written in violation of the Sherman Act, brought into court,
      they would have had a case. But then it was I, a lowly track buyer
      comparable to the complainant, who had by some hook or crook, aided by a
      swift kick in the pants, bolted through the barrier that was keeping Oscar
      out of the Association.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This, a continuation of the preceding article, brings
      us up to the second phase of my grain dealing experience. The businessmen,
      and some who were not so businesslike, organized what they called a Board
      of Trade, purportedly for the enhancement of the town&#8217;s interest&#8212;but,
      in reality, as events proved, to locate an outside man in the grain
      business here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Goff had two merchants advertising in my newspaper</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">one a particularly live
      businessman&#8212;quoting prices, and drawing trade away from this
      territory. Even people living right here in town would go up on the noon
      train, and come back at four o&#8217;clock, loaded with purchases.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There had been discussions as to whether or not it was
      morally legitimate for the local paper to accept outside advertising when
      in competition with the home merchants&#8212;and the publishers all around
      had decided that it was quite legitimate, especially when the home
      merchants did not make liberal use of the paper&#8217;s space. Yet, I
      doubted if it was wise for me to do so. However, I do not think I was
      violating the code of loyalty when I prayed for a live merchant like Mr.
      Abbott.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Board of Trade had come to life in Moulton De-Forest&#8217;s
      office across the hall from my printing office, on a Thursday night. My
      name, mentioned for possible membership&#8212;I was told, later&#8212;was
      discussed at length. I was the culprit, at least it was I who owned the
      vehicle carrying the price-smashing ads which were making them unhappy.
      And though I was at the time publishing The Spectator, doing job printing,
      buying and shipping grain, writing fire insurance, selling real estate,
      and making more farm loans than both the other assembled loan agents,
      there was doubt if I should be classed as a businessman, in</span> <span>the
      true</span> <span class="c2 c0">sense. Stupid as this may seem, it is a
      fact. The reason for it is not apparent&#8212;yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There were in this organization men who had been at
      odds, even fighting mad, over other activities. It seemed as though
      something nasty was always brewing then. The man who had not so long
      before been petitioned to leave town, and the fellow who had borne the
      liberally signed document to the printing office for public exposure, were
      now working together in an effort to push me around, simply because I had
      been so indiscreet as to accept outside advertisements.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The leading Prohibitionist had been especially active
      in trying to clean up the town. It had provoked the imbibers and the
      &#8220;blind-tiger&#8221; boys. They got up a petition asking the Prohib
      to leave town, and brought it to the Wolfley printing office, where I was
      in charge during the editor&#8217;s absence. I refused to print it. They
      berated me plenty. But they got handbills printed elsewhere&#8212;now
      signed &#8220;Committee.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Prohib did not choose to leave town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One of the &#8220;boys&#8221; got gloriously drunk&#8212;and
      bragged a little. The Prohib and the Drunk met in the middle of the main
      town square. There were a lot of people on the street. Ed Cawood, quite
      young then, is the only one now living that I recall. The Drunk struck at
      the Prohib, missed, and fell flat in the street. He had to have help to
      get up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Years later, I heard a brother of the Drunk, a highly
      respected, and ordinarily very truthful man, in telling the story, say
      that his brother (called by name) beat the Prohib up scandalously. You can&#8217;t
      rely on what the old fellows tell you. You&#8217;ve got to know it&#8212;or
      let someone who does know it, tell it. Hearsay, after it passes through a
      generation is not reliable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Here I wish to say that, except the grain business,
      the sidelines enumerated herein were acquired from the long established
      agency of S. C. Shuemaker, at the same time I bought the newspaper after
      his death, and that I was not butting in on anyone&#8217;s prior rights.
      Also, I want to say that the ones having those unreasonable notions, had
      axes to grind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, a committee came over to my office, and asked
      me to join them in Moulton&#8217;s office. I gave them $1.00 membership
      fee, and noted the freshly written by-laws calling for an additional dime
      for each and every time I might be absent from the regular Thursday night
      meeting. Keep this in mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The members who had no axes to grind were pretty
      decent. They felt the need of something to counteract the inroads the Goff
      merchants were making on the local merchants&#8217; business, and decided
      that a full front-page write-up in The Spectator was desirable. It was
      promised for the second week ahead. Nothing was said about paying for this
      service&#8212;and no payment was expected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Henry DeForest told those dominating members that they
      were acting like spoiled children, or worse&#8212;imbeciles. It is really
      surprising to what absurd lengths some fairly just people will sometimes
      go in trying to force their will upon others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Now, Thursday night was always a busy night with us</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but it was doubly so the next
      Thursday night. The Board fellows decided that they could not wait two
      weeks for the write-up, and asked me to advance it one week. I told them
      that we would accommodate them it we could get Mr. Abbott to reduce his
      space, or forgo the advertisement altogether. Mr. Abbott would oblige. And
      this was the straw that ultimately broke the spinal column of the Board of
      Trade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our full office force burned the midnight oil that
      Thursday night&#8212;and then some. The Board members trudging up to
      Moulton&#8217;s office could have looked in on us and seen that we were
      having no picnic. But, by golly, we were a little proud of our
      accomplishments, hoping it would please. And it did. The thing that caused
      me to lose faith in the Board was that paltry dime assessed against me for
      missing the meeting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The prime purpose of the Board was to locate an
      outside man in the grain business here, backed up by a stronger purpose of
      one of its members to sell an old canning factory building to be converted
      into an elevator:&#8212;plus one up-and-coming young doctor who was crying
      for an opposition paper, with political slant. The business was delegated
      to a committee of four&#8212;the canning factory owner, a relatively new
      doctor, and two other men.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At this time doctors, after petty politicians, were
      the bane of the local papers. It was considered by the profession
      unethical for them to advertise&#8212;yet, too often, they craved top
      newspaper recognition when only minor mention or none at all was due. The
      case in hand was the third, with as many different doctors, with which I
      had to contend&#8212;in every instance for what the paper failed to say
      about them, or what it did say about some other doctor. But I want to say
      that our old reliables, Dr. J. W. Graham, and Dr. Thomas Milam, did not
      fall into this category.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">However, the cases I had</span> <span>t</span> <span
      class="c0">o deal with were really mild</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">mild indeed to the one which threatened to do mayhem, or
      worse, to the whole office force, when I was printer on T. J. Wolfley&#8217;s
      Spectator. A doctor who had come down from Granada and located in Wetmore,
      sent word that he was going to pay us a visit at 10 o&#8217;clock of a
      Saturday morning for the express purpose of cleaning out the whole office.
      The offending item was a week old, and the demanded retraction in Friday&#8217;s
      paper had, as viewed by the Doctor, added &#8220;insult to injury.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Theodore Wolf ley really enjoyed a scrap&#8212;and
      managed to have something on tap nearly all the time. He represented one
      faction of the local Republicans, and Moulton DeForest, when not a
      pronounced Prohibitionist, essayed to control another faction. The Doctor,
      a husky farm-bred boy in the Granada neighborhood, now on honored citizen
      of Wetmore, was a rantankerous Republican allied with the De-Forest
      faction&#8212;until he switched to the Populist party without losing any
      part of his rantankerous attributes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Anticipating in advance the proposed call from the
      Doctor, Wolfley procured a revolver, and he and I practiced shooting the
      thing in the office, from a distance of ten feet, with target pinned on
      the leg of the imposing stone. He never hit the target once, but he broke
      a window pane all of two feet above the stone. He always shut his eyes and
      flinched before pulling the trigger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I was supposed to be stationed at the imposing stone,
      in pretense of performing my regular duties, with iron side-stick&#8212;a
      lethal weapon when expertly wielded&#8212;in readiness for my part of the
      defense, if, and when, the Doctor might extend his belligerence thus far.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The printing office at that time was over the old
      Morris store on the north side of the main street. A stairway went up on
      the outside, with turnback to the front porch above. At the appointed
      hour, heavy feet pounded on the stairs. I had all of one minute in which
      to visualize my precarious position. With each step on the stairs my
      nervousness mounted. The irate intruder would of necessity be stationed
      somewhere between the editor and his foreman. The thing that worried me
      was my boss&#8217; unpredictable marksmanship.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But it was not the Doctor&#8217;s heavy feet on the
      stairway. He had sent his understudy, Joe Eyman, who also was a husky
      bigfooted farm-bred boy from up in the Granada neighborhood. Joe fixed
      matters so that the Doctor and the Editor could talk it out between
      themselves. And in good time Joe became eligible to write MD after his own
      name. He then married Hattie Smarr, and they went to Sundance, Wyoming, to
      hang out his shingle. She was known in later years, in Wetmore, as Mrs.
      Stalder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I am not sure if the belligerent Doctor&#8217;s
      grievance was professional or political. Probably the latter&#8212;but I
      do know that he was touchy in a professional way, for he later accounted
      for one-third of my unfavorable experience with doctors, as earlier
      mentioned in this writing. His successor in the Granada field had sent in
      by our Granada correspondent, a dollar&#8217;s worth of advertising, in
      the form of a personal, which had piqued the Old Doctor, causing him to do
      a bit of rantankerous snorting at me. But I did not rush out and buy a
      gun. I used the weapon I already had. The paper ignored him&#8212;and that
      whipped him into line in about one year. And he was ever after that my
      friend&#8212;with full &#8216;appreciation of the silent power of the
      press. He was a good doctor, and a good fellow&#8212;when he was good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As Populist crusader, the Doctor was a success. His
      advertised meetings drew big crowds. He always brought in a principal
      speaker. One time he had two billed for the same night&#8212;&#8221;Sockless&#8221;
      Jerry Simpson and &#8220;Peruna&#8221; Jerry Botkin&#8212;but he got Mary
      Ellen Lease, instead. The Doctor and his two very fine little girls,
      Bertha and Belle, led the singing. The Doctor himself was not a noted
      vocalist&#8212;but he bore down heavily on the refrain of his favorite
      Populist song, &#8220;Turn The Rascals Out.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, let me add that any time the editor of a local
      paper lets the politicians handle him, he is going to be woefully out of
      luck. Politics was dirty then. If an editor was a Republican, he was
      expected to engage in mud-slinging, shying the muck at all and sundry
      Democrats, regardless of their standing as citizens. The mere favorable
      mention of Republican candidates was not enough. And if he were true blue,
      he must keep up a barrage against editors of Democratic papers, and vice
      versa, a sort of nonsensical exchange of blasts. I steadfastly refused to
      be drawn into their political scraps. They called me a &#8220;mugwump.&#8221;
      But Gov. E. N. Morrell said&#8212;put it in writing&#8212;that inasmuch as
      I had succeeded in keeping my political skirts clean that I was a
      high-minded Republican. My hardest task was to hold down a brilliant and
      goshawful sarcastic local politician who wanted to engage in muck-raking,
      over the assumed name &#8220;Samantha&#8221; in my paper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Politics was something to be shunned by me&#8212;that
      is, from a business standpoint in connection with the publication of the
      newspaper. I once went over to Edgerton, in the Missouri hills beyond
      Rushville, to investigate an offer of $1,000 bonus for the establishment
      of a newspaper. I struck the town at a time when a teachers&#8217;
      convention was being held there. The banker, who was on the committee
      welcoming the teachers, was also on the committee pulling for the paper,
      and he had arranged the appointment with me. Mistaking me for a professor,
      he gave me a hearty handshake, and welcomed me along with the teachers
      getting off the same train. When I got up town, I called at his bank&#8212;and
      was &#8220;welcomed&#8221; again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;What&#8217;s your politics?&#8221; he asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Republican,&#8221; said I.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Your train leaves in one hour,&#8221; said he.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I did not know Missourians as well then as I do now.
      The banker laughingly said, &#8220;Stick around awhile&#8212;I will talk
      the matter over with you when I get a moment&#8217;s time.&#8221; He told
      me that there were only two Republicans in the township; that I could run
      the paper as an Independent until election time, and then I would be
      expected to be a good Democrat&#8212;a real old &#8220;Missouri Mossback&#8221;
      and no foolin&#8217;, I think the order would have been. I judged they did
      not want a newspaper. They wanted a political &#8220;organ.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On invitation of the banker, I attended a meeting in the
      school house, which was set in a natural oak grove</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and met many sociable and interesting people. In the
      gathering, there were a lot of pretty girls&#8212;and all in all, it
      looked to me as if it would be a swell place for a young fellow to settle
      down. But&#8212;while I wouldn&#8217;t know why I was a Republican, I
      couldn&#8217;t pretend to be something that I was not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A young doctor from Goff had come here to make his
      professional start. He first took his old schoolmate, Ecky Hamel, to task
      for calling him by his given name, demanding that he be addressed as
      &#8220;Doctor.&#8221; Ecky had gravitated from country school teacher to
      printer and reporter, and thought he himself was some pumpkins, too. But I
      don&#8217;t think this was held against the Doctor when Ecky wrote the
      five-line item that touched off the explosion&#8212;caused the Doctor to
      whoop-it-up for a competing paper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The offending item merely said that &#8220;Dr. Jermane of
      Holton, who had operated on Lyman Harvey here last week for appendicitis,
      had died of a like operation at Holton this week.&#8221; A Philadelphia
      lawyer could have found no fault with this&#8212;but the local doctor
      thought it was a reflection on his professional ability. Knowing that he
      had brought the Holton doctor here to do the job, and knowing also that
      the local doctor had been duly recognized in the item reporting the Harvey
      operation, I thought he had no kick coming</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and let it go at that. And anyway, Mr. Harvey had also
      died of his operation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The complaining doctor was a hustler, socially a good
      fellow, very much on the way up in his profession, when a catastrophic
      repercussion reduced him to the level of the ice-man. As attending
      physician, he had brought into the world an illegitimate child whose birth
      was a great embarrassment for its little mother and the maternal
      grandparents. And on a subsequent call at the country home he discovered
      the child was missing. I am not familiar with the details at this stage of
      the affair, but rumor had it that the doctor turned sleuth and dug up the
      fact that the child was buried in the back yard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The home folks, older members of the family, contended
      that it had died of natural causes&#8212;pneumonia, I believe. The doctor
      was wholly within his rights when he reported the matter to the
      authorities&#8212;but he did not prove an apt witness in court. Two older
      doctors from the north part of the county, combined and &#8220;proved&#8221;
      in effect, on the witness stand that the young doctor did not know enough
      about such matters to make a case.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the ice business in a southern Kansas town the
      fellow made good. And though the &#8220;injured&#8221; doctor had kept on
      whooping-it-up for a competing paper until he did, with the help of some
      disgruntled politicians, put me out of the newspaper business, I&#8217;m
      glad to say he was not one to carry a grudge beyond the time of its actual
      usefulness to him. Just for old friendship&#8217;s sake, he wrote me from
      the office of his artificial ice plant&#8212;owned jointly with his
      brother&#8212;complimenting me on one of my articles in W. F. Turrentine&#8217;s
      Spectator. This note on the background of the doctor is given here for
      reasons which will appear later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">J. W. Coleman, publisher of the Effingham New Leaf,
      having conceived the idea that a string of local papers along the Central
      Branch, would be the motive power to land him in a fat political job, came
      here to negotiate with me for the Spectator. My paper was not for sale.
      The doctor and the political boys combined to</span> <span>persuade</span>
      <span class="c0">Mr. Coleman that a second paper would be preferable. It
      would seem the MD and PB&#8217;s did not want to crush me on the spot&#8212;or
      maybe it was their idea of one huge joke to let me die a slower death. In
      either event, it was the wedge that pried me loose from The Spectator. I
      sold to Coleman. I did not permit this to cause me to break with the
      Doctor and my political friends</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">as there was the outside chance that they might have been
      misquoted by the over-anxious purchaser. And then, too, it was not long
      before I really liked it. It afforded me time to give my full attention to
      other more congenial matters</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">for getting married, for instance. The wife said it was a
      great stroke of good luck for me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had weathered one brief, and I may say clean siege
      of competition, which had proved that the town was not large enough to
      support two papers. P. L. Briney, with his two daughters, Bertha and
      Olive, wholly on their own&#8212;that is, without MD&#8217;s or PB&#8217;s
      moral support&#8212;established and published the Enterprise for about one
      year. Unable to make a go of it, Mr. Briney sold the whole outfit&#8212;exclusive
      of the girls, of course&#8212;to me for $125, his first asking price.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Coleman did not last long enough here to do the
      political boys any good. He got off on the wrong foot in an early issue.
      He attended a recital given by Edith McConwell&#8217;s music pupils&#8212;and
      ridiculed it. Our people did not like to have their kiddies ridiculed&#8212;nor
      their music teacher either, who was once a kiddie here herself. However,
      after a few issues by Coleman, Art Sells, also of Effingham, took charge,
      and gave the people&#8212;not the politicians&#8212;a very satisfactory
      paper. Coleman gave up his political aspirations, sold his two papers, and
      took the job of City Editor for the Atchison Daily Globe. However, Coleman&#8217;s
      successor, W. F. Turrentine, held forth twenty years longer than the
      fourteen years that I had published the Spectator before giving up the
      ghost about five years ago. The idle plant is still in Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">To give a clear picture of the grain situation I
      should explain that Mr. Baker, of the Greenleaf-Baker grain firm, of
      Atchison, had asked me why would it not be a good idea for me to build an
      elevator here? I told him that I did not think there would be business
      enough, from year to year, to justify me in so doing&#8212;which, I might
      say, was a fact fully demonstrated in later years. I pointed out that with
      the large feeding interests here; and in the north territory, particularly
      at Granada, where the Achtens sometimes bought as much as one hundred
      thousand bushels of corn for feeding cattle and hogs; that practically all
      the south territory was in pasture land; and with two elevators at Goff
      and- two at Netawaka, we could hardly expect to draw trade away from them
      without making costly inducements, as we were now doing in our track
      buying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Baker said, &#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll build
      one for you. It will save you paying a premium to get the corn, and make
      it more convenient for you to handle it.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I think the Board members did not know this at the
      time of organizing. But the committee, composed of the man who had a
      canning factory building to sell, and the doctor who wanted a competing
      newspaper with political slant, both uncompromisingly for the Goff man,
      and two other men who had a tendency to view things in their proper light,
      met with a representative of the Greenleaf-Baker firm in &#8216;the opera
      house here. The spokesman for the committee told Frank Crowell, Mr. Baker&#8217;s
      brother-in-law, and member of the firm, that they preferred to locate
      their man Reckeway, because it would bring another family to town and
      consequently make a bit more business for the local merchants. Mr. Crowell
      told them that we would like to have their friendship and co-operation&#8212;but,
      regardless of whether or not they located Mr. Reckeway, that his firm
      positively would build the elevator as planned. The two silent members on
      the committee packed power enough only to delay action.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As it is now all water over the dam, with not even a
      trickle of cankerous aftermath, it is not my purpose to show up the old
      Board of Trade boys in a critical light&#8212;but it was evident that they
      were not being guided by the Golden Rule. They knew the Greenleaf-Baker
      people were going to build an elevator, when they located their man. They
      knew also that in normal crop years there would hardly be business enough
      here to sustain one elevator. As a sort of excuse for them pulling for the
      Goff man, the spokesman said to me, &#8220;You know, if we don&#8217;t get
      our man located this year, we may never get an elevator. We have never had
      a corn crop like this before, and we may never have another one.&#8221; It
      was not strictly a Christian act&#8212;and I suspect they never had any
      regrets for having turned the trick. It was apparently their way of
      building up the town&#8212;and, incidentally, securing a buyer for an old
      canning factory building.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Canning Company, a local organization, having
      failed to bring in the expected returns, and having accumulated debts in
      excess of its ability to pay, had liquidated, the building going to the
      highest bidder, one Theodore Wolfley by name&#8212;uncle of Editor
      Theodore Wolfley. Then, later, it was planned by the holders of the
      worthless canning factory stock&#8212;and others&#8212;to try to recoup
      their losses by the establishment of a cheese factory, with an eye on the
      old building as a prospective site. It was then that the present owner
      hopped out and bought the old canning factory building, hoping to turn a
      neat profit. But the cheese factory promotion fell by the wayside. It was
      then patent to the purchaser that he had over-played his hand. Knowing
      these facts, one can better understand his sudden anxiety for an elevator&#8212;for
      the good of the town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Their prospect, W. M. Reckeway, who had been operating
      the Denton elevator at Goff, likely misunderstanding the Committee, gave
      out an interview in the Goff Advance, saying that they had bargained for
      the Worthy dump, and that it was his intention to build a modern
      up-to-date elevator in Wetmore, but J. T. Bristow had slipped in and
      bought it away from them&#8212;the inference being that the good people of
      Wetmore who had longed for an elevator for lo these many years, would now
      have to take what they could get&#8212;something less than would have been
      the case had Bristow behaved himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Had this been true&#8212;the way I look upon such matters</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">it would have been both shrewd
      and legitimate business on my part, though it would have left an ominous
      smirch on Mr. Worthy. But it was far from the truth. The Board Committee
      had not bargained for the Worthy dump.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">As has been pointed out, the Greenleaf-Baker Grain
      Company had already planned to build an elevator here for my convenience,
      as a shipper&#8212;but of course the company was not in the market for the
      old canning factory building. My Company, as well as their prospect&#8212;not
      the Committee</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">wanted a
      better location. Mr. Baker instructed me to buy the Worthy dump, solely
      for the location.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Knowing the canning factory owner like a book, I did not
      even suspect that they would consider the Worthy location. And as a matter
      of fact, the Board Committee apparently did not want the Worthy dump&#8212;only,
      at any rate, as a last resort. When I called on Mr. Worthy, he said,
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve given the Board of Trade fellows an option on it for
      $200, good until noon today. Come back here promptly at twelve o&#8217;clock.
      Now don&#8217;t wait until after dinner,&#8221; he warned. The Committee
      went to Mr. Worthy after one o&#8217;clock, asking for an extension of the
      option. That old canning factory was still in the way. And the owner did
      not exactly pat me on the back, but looked as if he wanted to when he
      learned that I had bought the Worthy dump. I did not get the doctor&#8217;s
      reaction to this&#8212;but I do know that, though we continued on friendly
      terms&#8212;we never had any clashes</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">he continued to &#8220;harp&#8221; for a competing paper,
      with political slant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Reckeway, being handy with hammer and saw,
      converted the old canning factory building into an elevator in time for
      the fall business. The people, including the Board of Trade boys, had an
      erroneous notion that an elevator operator could pay more for corn than
      the track buyer, and while the reverse is true, they had located their man
      with this belief. Then that new man did give me a merry chase&#8212;in
      fact he put me completely out for a spell. He paid more for corn than I
      could get for it. How come? Well, the BT boys gave credit to the old
      canning factory. They were wrong of course.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It may be a little early to bring this in&#8212;but
      Mr. Reckeway was making some profit on the sale of a carload of flour he
      had brought in, but he could not count on a repeater in this line, for he
      had already been told by the canning factory vendor&#8212;who sold flour
      in his general store at substantially higher prices&#8212;to cut it out.
      It was made plain to the fellow that he had not been brought here to
      compete With the home merchants.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I&#8217;ll get around to aft explanation of how and
      why Mr. Heckeway bid up the price on corn&#8212;but this seems the
      opportune time to slip in a line about the entry of a business which led
      all competition. And lo, the man was from Goff, the town which had
      furnished me a competitor in the grain business, and a politically minded
      doctor who wanted a competing paper&#8212;and ironically enough, the town
      whose advertising merchants, C. C. Abbott, John Wendell, and George
      Bickel, were the thorns that had been pricking the Board of Trade boys&#8217;
      sensitive hides.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. C. C. Abbott, the live merchant&#8212;the man
      whose advertisements in my paper had given so much concern at the Board of
      Trade&#8217;s first meeting, and was the cause for that elaborate
      write-up, had moved in on them with a complete new stock of general
      merchandise, locating in the old Stowell brick building, the present
      Catholic recreation hall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, let &#8216;em kick!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The energetic efforts of the dominating member of the
      Board Committee to close a deal for the sale of that old canning factory
      building had, unwittingly of course, also paved the way for the entry of
      some live competition for himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Abbott became my best advertiser. Legitimate, too.
      He paid, in trade, three to five cents a bushel premium for ear-corn, and
      turned it to me at the market price. Also, there was a general come-down
      of prices in the other stores. Now was I, or was I not, working for the
      best interests of the town?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Evidently Mr. Reckeway had a threefold purpose in
      bidding up the price of corn. He wanted to build up a reputation, wanted
      to crush competition, and at the same time discourage the Greenleaf-Baker
      people in their plans to build an elevator here. The word got around that
      I was going to try to operate the Worthy dump &#8220;as is.&#8221; It
      would have not been fruitful for them to let Reckeway know the truth at
      this stage of their dickerings&#8212;hence the circulated report that I
      had bought the Worthy dump, aiming to operate it myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Nor did Mr. Reckeway know that the order for the
      lumber in special lengths had been given to a mill in Arkansas the day
      after I had bought the Worthy dump, when he betook himself to Atchison in
      an effort to dissuade the Greenleaf-Baker firm from building, pointing out
      that he had the grain business corralled here; that I was now a &#8220;dead
      duck,&#8221; without standing in my own community. Mr. Baker was not
      impressed by Mr. R.&#8217;s pleadings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr. Reckeway had been shrewd enough</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">or lucky enough&#8212;to sell, in early fall, a
      sizable quantity of December corn at a price above the settled market. He
      had been sloughing off his profits to the farmers to create atmosphere&#8212;and
      to stop me. Many of his old Goff customers were now bringing their corn to
      him in Wetmore, a high testimonial of his popularity&#8212;and a welcome
      morsel for the aggressive half of the BT Committee to peddle in support of
      their earlier expressed contention that an elevator man could actually pay
      more for corn&#8212;even, so to speak, pull rabbits out of a hat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Had Mr. Reckeway made it win, it would have been good
      business. As it was, I&#8217;m not shrewd enough to say whether it was
      good business or bad business. The one certainty is that he did not make
      the goal he was shooting for.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Owing to delay in getting the lumber, the Baker
      elevator did not open for business until January 5. Reckeway had now quit
      playing for atmosphere. Then, we both got more corn than we could
      conveniently handle, as a car shortage had developed, which slowed down
      shipments.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We had a little bad luck the very first day the Baker
      elevator was opened for business. We were getting corn from three
      shelters, about 4,000 bushels that day&#8212;and some of the wagons came
      in after dark. Elmer Brockman, the builder, was looking after the elevator
      end of the first day&#8217;s run. I weighed a wagon, told the driver to
      wait for Elmer to signal him in with his lantern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Something had gone wrong, and Elmer had taken his
      lantern and stepped out of the driveway. Mr. farmer, after pulling up and
      stopping, decided that he didn&#8217;t need a lantern to guide him&#8212;and
      he drove on in and got one horse part way in the open dump. The horse lost
      patches of hair in two or three places, but was not otherwise injured. The
      next day the fellow came back and wanted to sell me the horse for $100.
      The old plug was worth only about $40. I didn&#8217;t want to buy the
      horse at any price, and I didn&#8217;t want the man to go away
      dissatisfied. And I suspicioned&#8212;correctly&#8212;that some of my
      competitor&#8217;s supporters might be back of the fellow. I suggested
      that I send Milt Cole, the liveryman, out to the farm to examine the horse&#8212;and
      that I would pay him whatever amount that the two of them might decide
      would be just. Mr. Cole said $40 would be a big plenty&#8212;and I paid
      it. Then, about a week later the farmer, pleased with his high-handed
      stroke of luck, had the nerve to tell me that I was an easy mark, that the
      horse was as good as ever, and that I had virtually thrown away forty
      dollars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, this man was on a farm owned by an Illinois man&#8212;a
      Mr. Smith, who had entrusted me with the rental of the place. The farmer
      had contracted to pay cash rent, with a clause in the contract stating
      that in case of drought, or for any cause lowering the normal yield, that
      a substantial reduction would be allowed. Mr. Smith was a firm believer in
      the old principle of &#8220;live and let live.&#8221; But he soon found
      out that it wouldn&#8217;t work so well here. And anyway, it was mostly
      his sister&#8217;s idea&#8212;she having an interest in the land.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The tenant had asked for a reduction. Well, Mr. Smith
      came to my printing office one day, borrowed my shotgun, pulled on new
      overalls, and went out to his farm to hunt a bit. He found the tenant at
      the house, asked for and received permission to hunt. Mr. Smith said
      truthfully he had just got in from Minnesota, and casually asked about
      crops in general here. The tenant said they had been good, and he bragged
      a little about how well he himself had done that year. Mr. Smith&#8217;s
      sister lived in Minneapolis, and he had gone around that way to get her to
      yield a point on that stiff &#8220;live and let live&#8221; idea of hers&#8212;and
      to discuss plans for selling the farm. I sold it for them, later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might say here that another tenant the previous year
      had asked for, and received a reduction. The man had sold his corn. He
      patted his pants pocket, and told me, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the money all
      in here. They&#8217;ll have to settle my way, or not at all.&#8221; He was
      entitled to a reduction and I was sure Mr. Smith would do the right thing.
      And he did. I said to the tenant, &#8220;If you should lose that money we
      would have no chance to collect anything. Put your money back in the bank
      where it will be safe. If anything comes up, I&#8217;ll notify you in time
      for you to get it out before attempting to force a collection.&#8221; He
      said, &#8220;On your word, I&#8217;ll do that. Can&#8217;t sleep very well
      with the money in my britches, anyway.&#8221; This man was Albert W.
      Dixon. Don&#8217;t care to name the other fellow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This rather unusual incident got &#8220;noised&#8221;
      around, and the tenant:&#8212;the farmer with the &#8220;crippled&#8221;
      horse&#8212;being what he was, thought he might just as well do a little
      more gouging. Mr. Smith said to me, &#8220;Make that fellow pay in full&#8212;and
      get rid of him.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Still Mr. Reckeway was not satisfied. Having failed in
      his efforts to block the building of the west elevator, he now began a
      play to get control of it. And, finally, he did get it. During a grain
      dealers meeting at the Byram hotel in Atchison, Frank Crowell told me that
      my competitor was still after my &#8220;goat&#8221;&#8212;that Mr.
      Reckeway had just renewed his offer to give them all his shipments, if he
      could get control of the west elevator.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, let him have
      it&#8212;if it means anything to you?&#8221; Please note that Mr. Crowell
      and Mr. Baker were my sponsors. They would not let me down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Reckeway closed the west elevator.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When the new crop began to come in, I resumed track
      buying. I could have forgiven Mr. Reckeway for trying to squeeze me out&#8212;but
      now I would have to show him how badly he had been misled by his
      promoters, when he told the Greenleaf-Baker people that I was a &#8220;dead
      duck.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">We now had a new man in the depot. Agent Larkin was a
      fine Christian gentleman, an active church man. Also, he had a wife, and a
      pretty daughter who was a popular elocutionist&#8212;and a flock of 200
      chickens. He did not impress me as a man who could be influenced or bought
      for a few kernels of corn. However, when he asked permission to scrape up
      the waste around the car we had just loaded, it gave me an idea. I was not
      expecting any favors from this agent</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but I wanted to forestall the efforts of my competitor in
      demanding a division of cars on a comparable basis of his grand-elegant
      physical representation. When the boys would spill too little corn while
      loading the cars, I often climbed into the car and kicked out an extra
      bushel, sometimes more, before reporting the car ready for sealing&#8212;and
      of course I wouldn&#8217;t object to Agent Larkin gathering up the spilled
      corn, for his 200 chickens. I was getting an equal division of cars, and
      that was all I could reasonably expect&#8212;more, in fact, than seemed
      equitable to my competitor, with his investment in an owned elevator and
      his shrewdly acquired control of the Greenleaf-Baker elevator.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The idea that an elevator operator could pay more for
      corn than the track buyer was all wrong. An elevator is a convenience to
      the shipper, and helpful to a community</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but don&#8217;t forget for one moment that the grain
      producer must pay for it all. When track buying, I usually kept two men at
      the car, one inside the car and one to help the haulers shovel off their
      loads. I paid them 15 cents an hour. Tom and Juber Gibbons were horses to
      work then&#8212;but don&#8217;t look at &#8216;em now! And in long hauls,
      I would take the drivers to dinner at the Wetmore hotel, and feed their
      teams at Cole&#8217;s livery barn. The haulers, who were the seller&#8217;s
      neighbors, would complain about having to shovel the corn&#8212;but they,
      in turn, would bring me their corn for these extra helps, and extra money.
      One farmer who sold me 3,000 bushels said, &#8220;My neighbors will kick
      like the devil about having to shovel off their loads&#8212;but I reckon I
      kicked too when I shoveled off my loads when I was hauling for them.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On the basis of those magnificent holdings, Mr. Reckeway
      took his troubles to the higher-ups. Agent Larkin called me to the depot.
      Reckeway was there with a special representative of the railroad</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">the &#8220;trouble shooter.&#8221;
      Reckeway told his side of the story&#8212;very correctly, I must say. He
      owned outright an elevator, and he had control of the Greenleaf-Baker
      elevator as well</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and that
      firm was getting all his shipments. And, as a clincher, he said, &#8220;You
      know the Greenleaf-Baker people are heavy shippers over your railroad.
      They have elevators all along the Central Branch.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The special agent then asked me: &#8220;Have you any
      storage for grain?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;a bin with
      capacity for two car loads of shelled corn.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">His next question: &#8220;Did you ever have to pay
      demurrage for holding a car over-time while loading?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Again I replied, &#8220;Never.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The special agent&#8217;s final question, the one I
      was hoping he would ask me: &#8220;Where do you ship your corn?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;To the Greenleaf-Baker people in
      Atchison, as always.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Reckeway&#8217;s countenance showed surprise, if not
      real anger. The agents both laughed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Turning to Agent Larkin, the special agent asked:
      &#8220;Has he told the truth in all three instances?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said my chicken-owner
      friend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Then, give him every other car,&#8221; said my
      newly found friend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And Mr. Reckeway stalked out mumbling in jumbled
      English and German, of which I could catch only, &#8220;A man with two
      elevators&#8212;.&#8221; My reputation was now redeemed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The so-called &#8220;Board of Trade&#8221; had long
      since passed out. It was never a Board of Trade, anyway. Its operations
      were limited to the sale of one old canning factory building, and the
      location of Mr. Reckeway&#8212;that is, if we do not choose to count the
      location of Mr. Abbott. You know, I was a member of the Board, with dues
      and absentee penalties paid in full.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, let&#8217;s get this straight. I wouldn&#8217;t
      have been so resentful as to induce a live merchant like Mr. Abbott to
      move in on the homefolk. I just told him of the behavior of some of the
      Board members, and that I might have to deny him space in my paper.
      &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you will want to
      do that to me.&#8221; He winked. Well, I didn&#8217;t&#8212;really.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Abbott had been thinking things over ever since
      the time I had asked him to surrender his space in the interests of that
      elaborate write-up. Said he figured it would now be OK for him to bring me
      copy for a half-page advertisement announcing his location in Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">There were, however, many proposals advanced</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">but always they met with opposition from some member
      or members of the Board. In general, they kicked like the proverbial
      &#8220;bay steer&#8221; whenever something was advanced which might be
      helpful to one and detrimental to another. I think Mr. Worthy and I were
      the only ones who did not protest their proposals&#8212;such as bringing
      in Mr. Reckeway. And, frankly, until it had come to a showdown, I was not
      favored with too much information as to what Michael had up his sleeve.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I don&#8217;t know where they could have found a
      better man than Mr. Reckeway for the place&#8212;but he was no miracle
      man. Handicapped as he was, he found the going rather tough. And having
      found out also that the Board Committee&#8217;s prophesy was only a myth&#8212;that
      an elevator alone could not make two bushels grow where only one bushel
      grew before&#8212;after a few rather lean years, he departed for greener
      pastures. I believe Mr. Reckeway made good in the flour milling business
      at Girard, Kansas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Board of Trade sponsored (Reckeway) elevator,
      after years of idleness, has been torn down. Goff and Netawaka, like
      Wetmore, each now have only one elevator. And still the grain does not
      roll into Wetmore as was anticipated by the Board of Trade enthusiasts.
      Perhaps the old town may someday be favored with another set of
      progressives&#8212;who do not know their onions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I reiterate, there is no lingering malice in this
      writing. Collectively, year in and year out, the oldtime Wetmore people,
      despite all differences, were the best people I ever knew&#8212;and I
      lived in relative harmony with them for a long, long time. I&#8217;ve
      lived a lot of living in the old home town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And, thankfully, I&#8217;m still here.</span>

      <span class="c12 c0 c14">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the foregoing article I made reference to Theodore
      Wolfley&#8217;s poor marksmanship, with a revolver. When possible, I like
      to back up my assertions with proof. I now quote from a letter dated at
      St. Louis, April 5, 1941, written by T. J. Wolfley to his sister May
      Purcell, commenting on my writings in The Spectator, in which I likened a
      Belgrade story to a hot Wolfley editorial. It was at a time when a Hitler
      delegation was in Belgrade endeavoring to put pressure on the Yugoslavs to
      force them into the war on the Hitler side. The quote:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;I received the copy of the Wetmore Spectator,
      which you so kindly sent me. Thank you for it. I was interested in the
      story from Yugoslavia; and flattered to be even remotely connected with
      the incident by my friend John Bristow, who professes to think that if I
      wasn&#8217;t in St. Louis, I might be running a newspaper in Yugoslavia. .
      . . Just as in the political wars he mentioned, I was sometimes more
      friendly with the men I opposed than with the ones I favored. But the
      people liked it and it was then the accepted slogan to give the people the
      kind of news they wanted. . . . John was a good newspaper man and a good
      squirrel hunter, so we thought a little expert shooting might lend realism
      to the picture. But I wasn&#8217;t a good shot. I couldn&#8217;t even hit
      the imposing stone when it stood on the side against the wall. But I
      remember John could hit a penny when it laid on the floor at the leg of
      the imposing stone. So we depended upon John&#8217;s ability as a shooter
      to keep the enemy away. . . . Show this to John. A good many things
      happened in the Spectator office even after I quit, similar to the way
      they happen in Yugoslavia. He may remember some more.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, yes&#8212;I do remember one more. Always one
      more. But first I want to say that Theodore verifies the point I made in
      the preceding article&#8212;that he could not even hit the leg of the
      imposing stone, in his gun-practice. To those who are not familiar with
      the mechanics of the print-shop, the imposing stone is a heavy slab of
      marble mounted on a stand about waist-high, on which the forms of the
      newspaper are made up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When the Spectator was in its first year, I helped
      Theodore Wolfley carry out one of his &#8220;bright&#8221; ideas which
      gave him some sleepless nights. His sister Mary, still too young to carry
      on a flirtation with a grown man, had embarked on a whirlwind romance with
      a Central Branch railroad engineer. The heavy grade at the John Wolfley
      farmstead five miles west of Wetmore, made it possible for the engineer
      and the girl to exchange notes. And when they might desire a few moments
      time together, it was said, he would drop off at the crossing near her
      home, and then grab onto the caboose&#8212;and the fireman would take the
      long freight train into Goff.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Theodore told me that, as her older and wiser brother,
      he intended to break it up. He said it had got to a point when a talking
      to would do no good&#8212;and the girl was too big to spank. We printed a
      ten-line item in the Spectator, branding Mary&#8217;s Romeo as an all
      round bad character, even had him arrested and jailed for drunkenness&#8212;and
      credited the item to one of Atchison&#8217;s daily newspapers. After
      printing one copy for the Wolfley family perusal, I lifted the spurious
      item before running the regular edition.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Theodore commuted on horseback between farm and town
      at that time. He took the &#8220;doctored&#8221; paper home with him. He
      watched Mary read the item. He said she wrinkled up her nose, shook her
      head as if she meant to get even with someone. When he came back to the
      office the next day, he said, &#8220;I guess that will hold her.&#8221;
      But it didn&#8217;t.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the following day Theodore discovered the item had
      been cut out of the Spectator&#8212;and he rightly suspicioned it had been
      turned over to Mr. Romeo. He came to the office in agitated confusion. He
      asked me, &#8220;What paper did we credit that darned item to?&#8221; He
      had maligned an Atchison man and credited the item to one of the three
      Atchison daily papers&#8212;the Champion, the Patriot, or the Globe&#8212;which
      made him liable to attack from two angles. But luck was with Wolfley. John
      Reynolds, the engineer, came back promptly with his daily exchange saying
      the item referred to another John Reynolds living in Atchison&#8212;and
      the romance went merrily on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Theodore would have felt a lot easier had he known
      there actually was another John Reynolds living in Atchison. And though
      the second Mr. Reynolds had a shady record, he was never guilty of the
      things the item charged the engineer with. I have penned a line on this
      John N. Reynolds in another article. John A. Reynolds, the engineer, was
      really an honorable man, with high standing in Atchison. I came to know
      him well in later years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I shall carry on from here</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">after this paragraph</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">without Mr. Wolfley. But I&#8217;m not forgetting the Romeo
      engineer. And I should say here that Mary&#8217;s romance terminated
      without hitting the rocks, and that Theodore never had any complaints from
      Atchison. And I might say further, as a last tribute to my old friend,
      that Theodore Wolfley went from here to Phoenix, Arizona, and became
      editor of the Daily Republican, owned by ex-Governor Wolfley, of Arizona,
      (no relation), where he played up Republican politics to his heart&#8217;s
      content. From there he went to the St. Joseph (Mo.) Daily Gazette, where I
      imagine he would have been a loyal Democrat. And from St. Joe he went to
      the St. Louis Globe-Democrat as Financial editor. While in St. Joe
      Theodore wrote me that he was holding open for me a place on the Gazette
      paying four and one-half times the ten dollar weekly salary I was getting
      here. That was considered &#8220;big money&#8221; then. But I had promised
      Curt and Polly Shuemaker that I would remain on the job here when they
      bought the Spectator from John Stowell. Curt Shuemaker was blind&#8212;lost
      his eyesight from close bookwork in the Morris store and as the first
      cashier of the Wetmore State Bank. I could not quit them cold&#8212;but I
      was trying to find them a reliable printer when Curt sickened and died
      suddenly, leaving The Spectator in need of an editor as well. The quickest
      way to help out Polly was for me to buy The Spectator&#8212;at my own
      price. Not an unfair price, however. When Theodore was back home a short
      time before he died, having just read my manuscript of the Green Campbell
      story, he proposed that we buy The Spectator from the Turrentines&#8212;just
      to show the people what we could do. From past experience, I knew he could
      have shown them plenty&#8212;and I was afraid he might insist on doing it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Some years after Mary&#8217;s romance, I was walking
      past the depot in Wetmore with the girl who afterwards became my wife. Her
      home was on the south side of the tracks, near the watertank. The noon
      passenger train was at the tank. As we came abreast the engine the
      engineer hopped down from the cab, pulled off a leather gauntlet glove,
      and met the girl with a hearty handshake&#8212;and some hurried palaver.
      She introduced him as Mr. Reynolds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But you know, passenger trains must move on time</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and when alone with the girl, I
      said, &#8220;Let me see your hand.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;d
      never get a speck of dirt from shaking hands with Johnny Reynolds; he&#8217;s
      really quite particular about keeping himself clean of engine grime.&#8221;
      I learned later that she had told the truth in this particular&#8212;but
      how the devil did it come she knew so much about him? I said, &#8220;I
      think I know something about him that you do not know.&#8221; Then I told
      her about his exchange of notes with the Wolfley girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">She laughed and said, &#8220;Were you expecting to see
      a note in my hand? You don&#8217;t need to be afraid of Johnny Reynolds.
      He is engaged to a Miss Spelty, in Atchison.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Johnny&#8221; Reynolds had roomed at their home
      in Effingham before the family came to Wetmore, when Myrtle Mercer was
      eight years old. Being a very courteous man, he &#8220;made over&#8221;
      all members of the Mercer family whenever and wherever he might chance to
      meet them. And he had gotten lunches from their home in Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After her husband&#8217;s death in 1888, Myrtle&#8217;s
      mother had rather a hard time providing for her family of five girls,
      ranging in age from two to sixteen years. She was advised to open a
      boarding house for trainmen</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      others&#8212;but it settled down mostly to providing lunches for the two
      local freight train crews which passed through here about the noon hour. I
      think it was not very helpful. She was an excellent cook, and her
      twenty-five cent lunches were too elaborate to make money, even in those
      days. The passenger trains had stopped here for dinner before this. The
      hotel charged trainmen 25 cents&#8212;as was customary at all stops&#8212;while
      passengers paid 35 or 50 cents. Hence a 25 cent precedent for trainmen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The pinch was lifted, however, some years later, when
      Mrs. Mercer was granted a Government pension&#8212;for herself and the two
      younger children&#8212;with several years back pay. Though only 39 years
      old when he died, John Mercer was an &#8220;honorably&#8221; discharged
      soldier. He had enlisted in 1864, when only 15 years old. How he managed
      to get in at that age, is presumed to be the same as other under-age boys
      got in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One time when I was riding the local freight to
      Atchison, I saw Tom Haverty, the conductor, an Irish Catholic, open his
      lunch basket. It contained a big porterhouse steak cooked just right&#8212;it
      was a steak that would cost at least $2.50 now, with very few trimmings. I
      know that steak was cooked just right, for my wife had learned the art
      from her mother, and she had cooked many a one to the same turn for me.
      Well, Tom Haverty picked up that steak, held it as though he thought it
      might bite, walked to the opposite side of the caboose and chucked it out
      an open window.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was Friday.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After selling my newspaper, I found time to &#8220;putter
      about&#8221; on my farm one mile down the creek from town. I actually did
      a lot of worthwhile work, cleaning up the bottom land of brush, trimming
      hedge, and cutting cockle burrs with a &#8220;Nigger&#8221; hoe. I usually
      stuck a sandwich in my pocket for lunch&#8212;but sometimes Myrtle would
      prepare a real dinner, even steaks like I&#8217;ve been describing, carry
      it in a basket, sit down on the ground with me in the shade of hedge or
      tree, fight flies and gnats while eating, and pretend to enjoy it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One morning she said I need not take a lunch&#8212;that
      she was going to cook a real dinner, bring it down to the farm, and eat it
      with me. I told her I would come for dinner, and save her that long walk.
      She insisted that she &#8220;loved the walk, loved to get out in the open,&#8221;
      and I told her where to meet me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But she caught a ride most of the way. Green Goodwin,
      conductor of the local freight, told her to come aboard the caboose, that
      he would stop the train out near the farm and let her off. He had gotten
      lunches from her mother&#8217;s home. She said, &#8220;Mr. Goodwin said my
      lunch basket smelled good</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">like
      old times. He told a passenger in the caboose that he could always be sure
      of getting a good lunch at our home. I sure appreciated the ride, and I
      offered to give him my part of the lunch, but he wouldn&#8217;t take it. I&#8217;ll
      bet that traveling man who peeped in the basket wouldn&#8217;t have turned
      it down. But Mr. Goodwin did eat two of the cream-puffs: he said they were
      as good as the ones mamma used to put in his lunches. That leaves four
      cream-puffs for you&#8212;if I don&#8217;t eat any myself.&#8221; What
      manner of man would have eaten four cream-puffs&#8212;just then?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle felt pretty chesty about getting this ride&#8212;to
      think Green would stop his train on a steep grade, to save her the walk.
      Well, it was a pretty steep grade&#8212;and it was kind of Green to give
      her this lift. It recalled the time when, on several occasions, freight
      trains had stopped at that same place to let me off. And when the train
      had started to move again I could easily have beaten the engine to the top
      of the grade, in a running walk. But that would not Tiave been what I had
      been taken on the engine for, in town. I walked, or trotted slowly, ahead
      of the train pretty close to the creeping engine, shooing grasshoppers off
      the rails. After the 1874 invasion of grasshoppers freight trains could
      not make that grade until the rails were cleared of hoppers&#8212;and I
      had to stay close to the engine so that the hoppers would not fly around
      me and settle on the rails again. I was always &#8220;Johnny on the spot&#8221;
      to catch those rides. To ride the engine was a thrilling experience for a
      twelve-year-old boy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While eating our lunch that day, a covey of half-grown
      quail came out from between the rows at the end of a cornfield. Myrtle
      said they were so cute that it was a shame to kill them. &#8220;And if you
      shoot any more of them,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;I will not cook them
      for you.&#8221; I said that I guessed I could cook them myself&#8212;that
      I had roasted them suspended on a stick over a fire in the woods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll cook
      them, of course&#8212;but I promise you that I will never eat any more of
      them.&#8221; I tried her out on six birds. She cooked them, of course&#8212;and
      kept her promise. And then, in due time, I also thought they were too cute
      to be killed. But I continued carrying feed to the quail, in snowy times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While Wolfley said I was a good squirrel hunter, quail
      was really my game. I trapped them in my younger days, and shot them when
      old enough to be trusted with a gun. I &#8220;potted&#8221; them. In the
      old days quail sold for 5-cents each and no one would think of wasting a
      charge of ammunition on a single bird, especially while on the wing;
      though I did once shoot a lone quail sitting on top my figure-four
      cornstalk trap, under which were twenty live birds. We made our traps then
      with any old thing we could pick up and bind together. The twenty trapped
      quail had followed a tramped out path in deep snow, baited with a thin
      scattering of shelled corn, with a more generous supply of kernels under
      the trap&#8212;thus to engage the lead birds while the others were coming
      up, lest an impatient bird might go after the nubbin on the treadle and
      spring the trap too soon. I think trapping and &#8220;potting&#8221; were
      legal then. I winged them in later years, same as other sportsmen were
      wont to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One time while coming home from the farm on a Sunday
      morning about eleven o&#8217;clock, three teen-age boys caught up with me.
      They said they were from Fresno, California. I questioned them a little
      about Fresno, and decided they were telling me the truth. Also, I knew
      they were not professional tramps&#8212;and that they were hungry. I took
      them to the Wetmore hotel, and told Bill Cordon to give them their
      dinners, fill them up with double orders. One of the boys had about worn
      out his shoes&#8212;the sole of the left shoe was dragging, making it hard
      for the boy to keep up with his pals. While they were waiting in the hotel
      for the dinner call, I went to my home and hunted up a pair of shoes&#8212;almost
      new shoes, which pinched my feet&#8212;and took them, with a pair of clean
      socks, to the little fellow, and started them on their way back to Fresno,
      walking of course. On parting, the boy wearing my shoes, asked me why had
      I taken so much interest in them? I told them that I might be tramping
      myself someday, maybe even get as far away from home as Fresno, and in
      that event I hoped to meet them all again. This is what I told the boys.
      For the correct answer&#8212;it is enough to know that my people live in
      Fresno. One of the older boys said, &#8220;Never doubt, we&#8217;ll be
      there&#8212;if we ever do get back home.&#8221; And though I have been in
      Fresno a number of times since, I never had the pleasure of meeting any of
      them. I lost their names.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now&#8212;the $64 question!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A real honest-to-goodness professional tramp had
      hurriedly passed me by before the boys had caught up with me. I had a
      couple pork sandwiches in my pocket. My first thought was to offer them to
      this fellow&#8212;then thought that maybe he was not a tramp. A tractor
      had been running on a farm east of my place, and this fellow was just
      about smeary enough to have been the driver. I let him pass&#8212;and
      later saw him go into the depot. The wife and I were preparing to eat the
      sandwiches which were on the table still wrapped in oil paper. Then, this
      professional tramp showed up at our kitchen door, asking for a handout.
      Taking the two wrapped sandwiches off the table, I said, &#8220;Here you
      are, my man&#8212;I&#8217;ve been saving them for you.&#8221; I told him
      that had he not passed me by in such hurry on the railroad tracks, that I
      would have offered them to him then. He said he had been sick, and was
      hurrying to get in out of the weather. It had been &#8220;spitting&#8221;
      snow&#8212;which, I imagine, had caused my dinner guests at the hotel to
      wonder why did they leave their homes in sunny California. My home was two
      blocks away from the depot&#8212;and this was the tramp&#8217;s first
      call. Now&#8212;had this fellow &#8220;read my number&#8221; in passing on
      the railroad track? Or, did he read the sign at my home? It was said in
      the old days that tramps had a way of marking the favorable houses. My
      wife never let an applicant go away without something, little or much, to
      allay his hunger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I shall drop back a few years now and expand a bit on the
      trials and tribulations of my wife&#8217;s family&#8212;before she was my
      wife, understand. Married at the age of sixteen, and left a widow at the
      age of thirty-three, with little more than the home and a houseful of kids&#8212;all
      girls, at that</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Kate Mercer
      found herself in a highly discouraging predicament. Deprived of the
      bread-winner, the almost new five-room house on an acre of ground down by
      the creek, on the &#8220;wrong side of the tracks,&#8221; could now hardly
      be called a home. It had been ideally situated for the husband and father,
      who had been section foreman here for eight years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was no county welfare aid here then, as there is
      now. There was, however, in practice at that time the &#8220;good neighbor
      helping hand.&#8221; It consisted of raising a temporary fund by the
      circulation of a subscription paper. But when such a course was proposed
      by sympathetic neighbors, Mrs. Mercer, strongly backed up by her oldest
      daughter, declined to permit that. They would try somehow to get along
      without charity. They would go out and work. Thus, an up-hill drag was in
      store for them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle finished her schooling in May&#8212;though she
      said that with the readjustment problem confronting the family, and
      consequent worries, she feared she had made a rather poor job of it. Then
      she went out to work as domestic, or maid&#8212;just plain &#8220;hired
      girl&#8221; it was termed then. She worked two weeks in the home of the
      aristocratic Augusta Ann DeForest during the illness of Miss Mary Randall,
      the regular long-time maid. Myrtle said she could not have wished for a
      more congenial place to work. She dined with the family, notwithstanding
      the traditional rumors which said that such breaches of table etiquette
      were not tolerated in that home. And she said Mr. Henry, whom gossip
      claimed never even got to see the other cooks, was especially considerate,
      and told her not to try to overdo. That would be Mr. Henry, all right.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle worked for the eccentric Mrs. Draper, who was
      the mother-in-law of Charley DeForest. And she worked for Mrs. R. A.
      DeForest&#8212;and as chambermaid at the Wetmore hotel while her mother
      was the cook there. Of all her domestic &#8220;positions&#8221; Myrtle
      said she felt more at ease, and liked best to work for Linnie (Mrs. R. A.)
      DeForest. Linnie was the sister of the gracious Alice McVay, mentioned in
      another article. And Linnie was the mother of Harold DeForest, now living
      on a farm two miles northeast of Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle worked five weeks that first year for a young
      married couple who had come down from Granada to set up housekeeping in
      Wetmore with scarcely more than their love to go on. She quit them before
      the man had accumulated the money to pay her. The loss was only ten
      dollars, she said&#8212;but ten dollars would have been something toward
      keeping the family together. Myrtle said, &#8220;There ought to be a law
      preventing people from marrying before they are financially prepared for
      it.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That was a statement worthy of a philosopher.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the early winter of that first year the family went
      back to Illinois, the home of Mrs. Mercer&#8217;s people. Again Myrtle
      worked out at her enforced occupation as &#8220;hired girl.&#8221; Jennie,
      the second girl, went temporarily to an aunt, Mrs. Esther Noble&#8212;her
      father&#8217;s sister&#8212;in Bloomington. Georgia stayed with her aunt,
      Mrs. Henry Ham, in Bureau Junction. Kathy and Jessie remained with their
      mother in the home of Mrs. Mercer&#8217;s father, John Leonard, in Bureau&#8212;which
      railroad town was the home of the Mercers before they came to Kansas. They
      were all back in Wetmore within a few years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">James F. Noyes, a well-to-do retired farmer, living in
      Wetmore, adopted Georgia. He and his wife Jennie could</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and did</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">give
      her a good home. But after the novelty of the new life for the child had
      worn off, Georgia would &#8220;run away&#8221;&#8212;and go back home. The
      several occasions when she did this, made sorrowful times for the family.
      When matters became really serious, Georgia&#8217;s foster parents took
      her on an extended trip to visit Mrs. Noyes&#8217; brother, George Scott,
      in Oregon, hoping to cure her of her homesickness. Georgia married Don
      Cole and reared a family of two boys and three girls in the Noyes home.
      She never lost contact with all members of her mother&#8217;s family.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then there was an opportunity to have another of the
      girls adopted into a childless home. I don&#8217;t think the matter was
      considered seriously</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">not
      favorably, anyhow</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      Myrtle said she &#8220;Threw a fit.&#8221; No more adoptions, if she could
      help it. She&#8217;d just &#8220;bedarned&#8221; if anyone could have
      Jessie, the baby. So it came to pass that she got the care of Jessie
      herself&#8212;after her mother had married John Hall, and gone to live on
      a farm one mile west of Powhattan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Hall&#8217;s first wife, and mother of his four
      children, had stayed several months in Mrs. Mercer&#8217;s home while
      taking treatments of Dr. Haigh for the chronic ailment which caused her
      death. He had come over weekly to pay the bills. And he therefore knew
      just where to find himself another wife&#8212;provided.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The deliberating period was another trying time for the
      girls</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but after thorough
      consideration, mother and daughters were in complete agreement. It would
      perhaps be best for all of them, especially for the overburdened mother.
      And it was really good for all of them&#8212;the Halls included.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Mercer girls all finished their schooling in
      Wetmore. The two younger girls could have gone with their mother&#8212;it
      was so arranged&#8212;but they preferred to remain in Wetmore, most of the
      time. Jennie was offered the chance to work for her keep in Conductor
      Carlin&#8217;s home in Atchison, while taking a course in the Atchison
      Business College. She soon switched to the home of her uncle Stewart
      Mercer (a tailor) and his wife Mina, to act as baby sitter for little
      Esther, their first born. The Spectator, by virtue of some timely
      solicitation by Jennie&#8217;s older sister, and an advertising contract,
      contributed the tuition fee. Then Jennie went to work for a grain
      commission company in the Kansas City Board of Trade building. She worked
      in that one building as secretary and bookkeeper for different grain firms
      for the remainder of her life&#8212;more than thirty-five years. She never
      married.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Not that Jennie never had the chance. She turned down
      Danny Cromwell, a Kansas City boy, after he had secured the license. His
      sister Kate, a true friend and a very sensible girl, told Jennie that he
      had nothing, that he was sickly, without prospects&#8212;and that she
      would do well to sack him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then, too, Jennie had prospects of marrying her boss.
      But, after years of happy anticipation</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">you could see it written all over both their faces when they
      spent a vacation week with her relatives in Wetmore&#8212;it developed
      that this romance also was fraught with intolerable aspects. Her Romeo
      lived with, and was the sole support of an aristocratic mother who was
      allergic to working girls. Oh, those aristocratic mothers! A wise
      Nineteenth Century girl needed no advice. What think you a Twentieth
      Century girl would have done?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Jennie was helpful in securing positions in Kansas City
      for her younger sisters. Kathy worked as cashier and bookkeeper for the B.
      F. Coombs Produce Company down by the market, at Fifth and Main. She
      married Luther P. Hyre</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      reared a family of three girls and one boy, in Kansas City.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I think Kathy was the only one of the girls to inherit
      in a high degree her mother&#8217;s Irish wit. I don&#8217;t care if she
      was my mother-in-law, Kate Leonard - Mercer - Hall was a witty woman. And
      what&#8217;s more, I never could understand the why of so much criticism
      of the mother-in-law.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, little Virginia Hyre, Kathy&#8217;s first born,
      was a bright kid. Note this. Percy Worthy had gone to the farm with me to
      get a load of posts. Little Virginia, my wife&#8217;s short three-year-old
      niece, tiny and talkative, was taken along. The posts were in a small
      depression on the edge of a cornfield. I lifted the little girl out of the
      wagon and stood her on higher ground. She remained quiet while we loaded
      the posts. When Percy started to pull out, the front wheels of the wagon
      hit soft ground, sinking to the hubs, stalling his big bay team. He lashed
      the horses&#8212;mildly of course&#8212;and yelled fearsome notes of
      encouragement. Virginia set up a howl&#8212;screamed as if the lashes and
      frightening words were falling on her little tender person. Percy climbed
      down off the wagon to investigate. Virginia stopped her howling and said
      with broken sobs, puncturing each word with her little right hand swinging
      up and down, &#8220;I know what&#8217;s the matter, Uncle John.
      You-just-got-too-many-posts!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And again, nearly a year earlier, after the child had
      spent a month in our home, Virginia&#8217;s mother had come out from
      Kansas City to take her baby home. At the last minute, when they were
      seated in the passenger coach, Virginia decided she did not want to leave
      us, and she tearfully argued the matter with her mother&#8212;to no avail.
      As the train started to move the little girl, tiny and tearful, standing
      up in the seat, thrust her head and outstretched arms out an open window,
      and sobbed, &#8220;Uncle John, don&#8217;t you want me?&#8221; That did
      something to me. The fact was, we did want her. And I could have made the
      flying catch</span> <span></span> <span class="c0">all right&#8212;but her
      wardrobe would have gone on to Kansas City. Virginia came back to our
      home, later, and started to school here, but she &#8220;fell out&#8221;
      with her teacher&#8212;and was carted back to Kansas City again. &#8220;I
      just don&#8217;t like Miss</span> <span class="c2 c0">Peters&#8221; is all
      we could get her to say. Miss Myra Peters was the primary teacher who had
      for many years been adored by the little tots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After a brief spell as Kathy&#8217;s assistant with
      the Coombs Company, Jessie came back to try country life again. She
      married Will Hall, her step-father&#8217;s son. One time when Myrtle and I
      were visiting the Halls they took us to a Masonic program and supper in
      Powhattan. I was sitting with Mr. Hall when a friend of his from Hiawatha
      asked, &#8220;Who is that pretty girl in red over there with your son?&#8221;
      Mr. Hall said, drolly&#8212;he was a slow talker when he wanted to be
      impressive&#8212;&#8221;Well, she is my wife&#8217;s daughter; and my son&#8217;s
      wife.&#8221; The friend looked puzzled for a few seconds, then said,
      &#8220;I get it.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I shall now have to drop back once more. At this time
      Myrtle Mercer was working in my printing office, and she and Jessie were
      living in the home place down by the creek. My brother Theodore and his
      wife Mattie, living on my Bancroft farm, had given Myrtle a Great Dane
      puppy. It grew into a very large dog. With Vic as protector, the girls
      felt secure in their rather isolated home between the timber and the
      tracks. Hoboes were numerous along the railroad in those days. The girls
      were not bothered by tramps, with Vic around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Historically noted, the pup&#8217;s mother, aided by a
      visiting male dog of like breed from over near Hiawatha, had got herself
      in bad repute by taking down a stray cow that had come into the front yard
      where the tender spring grass made better pickings than were obtainable on
      the roadside. After being poorly wintered, roadside pickings were the cow&#8217;s
      only chance for sustenance. The cow was the property of a roving family
      consisting of father, mother, and five kids, that had wintered in the Jake
      Brian farm house a half mile away. The cow was trespassing, of course&#8212;but
      there were the kids to be considered. My brother paid the man for the cow.
      He already had possession of her. She was still down in his front yard.
      But in time, she got up&#8212;and was driven with other stock six miles to
      Uncle Bill Porter&#8217;s pasture for a summer&#8217;s outing. She never
      got back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When the pup was brought to town, the record of the
      old dogs followed&#8212;and as he grew to be a monstrous dog he was feared
      by some people who knew him only by his breeding. Then the town got a
      mad-dog scare. Vic was reportedly seen fighting with the suspected mad-dog
      down in the lower part of town&#8212;on &#8220;Smoky Row.&#8221; The
      informer recanted later&#8212;but that did not help matters after Vic had
      been killed by order of the City Marshal. I think the dog&#8217;s
      overly-advertised ancestry had marked him for annihilation. Thus, &#8220;the
      sins of the parents were visited upon the son&#8221; to the extent of
      needless distrust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Vic was a good dog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle said she couldn&#8217;t believe her dog was
      seen fighting with another dog on the town-side of the tracks, as he was
      never known to leave the home alone. But she felt that it was best to be
      on the safe side. And then too an order was an order. She wished that it
      had come a week earlier, so as to have saved her the dollar tax she had
      paid the City Marshal for the privilege of keeping Vic another year. It
      was a tragedy that the girls&#8217; watchdog was to be killed because of
      that false alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Here I will put in a word on my own hook. I knew Ed
      Lazelere had stuck the pup headfirst into a rubber boot and given him a
      treatment designed to keep the dog at home. It really worked. In his
      mature years Vic was never known to leave the premises alone, and seldom
      with either of the girls. His one mistake in his puppy days was when he
      followed Myrtle, unbidden, to the Lazelere home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Frosty Shuemaker was detailed to do the shooting. I went
      along to help get the dog away from the house. Vic was in the back yard in
      the shade of an apple tree. He wouldn&#8217;t budge for us. Myrtle came to
      the back door, and said she would have Jessie lead him over to the creek
      bank west of the house. Frosty and I went around to the front</span>
      <span></span> <span class="c2 c0">of the house, and then west on the
      outside of the yard fence to where there was an opening in the enclosure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Jessie and the dog came running. Vic stopped broadside
      opposite the opening, and was knocked down with a single charge from
      Frosty&#8217;s double-barreled shotgun&#8212;when Jessie was halfway back
      to the house. She did not look back. She held in until the booming report
      of the shotgun</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">then let
      out a terrific squawk. We dragged the dead dog outside the yard fence and
      left it in a weed patch. Vic was now the City&#8217;s dog. The Marshal
      would get a dollar for burying him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back at the house Myrtle, red-eyed and sorrowful,
      asked me what had become of Jessie? I found the kid in a patch of
      marijuana over by the east line of the grounds, lying face down&#8212;crying
      her heart out. And I think I dropped a few tears, too. You know, there are
      times when you can&#8217;t fight them back.</span>

      <span class="c0">Cloy spent the first five years of her life in my home&#8212;separate
      apartment. When she was about one year old, I often carried her down town
      and got her an ice cream cone. She was just beginning to walk, that
      awkward period when a child has to spraddle and step fast to hold its
      equilibrium. At times when she would be with her mother on the settee at
      the north end of the 22-foot front porch when I might choose to come
      around from my apartment to the south end, she would make known to her
      mother her desire to be put down on the floor, and she would come cooing
      with outstretched arms for me to pick her up. And while she could not
      talk, her mind was, I&#8217;m sure, on a cone somewhere down town. I never
      aimed to disappoint her</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      one time when I had been working in my Rose Garden and was plenty tired, I
      tried to talk her out of it, put her off. She could not understand all I
      was saying, of course&#8212;but she caught the general idea all right.
      Never again did she come a-cooing to me with outstretched arms. This is
      not to say we did not get more cones.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Cloy was about four years old, she had a line-up
      for me to participate in a social activity of the family. I said, &#8220;No,
      Cloy, I couldn&#8217;t do that&#8212;I don&#8217;t belong. She said,
      &#8220;Well, gee&#8212;you&#8217;re one of us, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span>

      <span class="c0">When hardly five years old, Cloy found me, at night,
      standing on the old National Bank corner. She asked me if I would give her
      a nickel&#8212;said she had one nickel, and wanted to buy a 10-cent
      lipstick at the Wells store for her mother. I said, &#8220;Cloy, your
      mother does not use lipstick.&#8221; &#8220;Oh yes she does,&#8221; said
      Cloy, &#8220;the kind that don&#8217;t show.&#8221; I did not have a
      nickel, and offered to go with her to the Wells store. She said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t
      you get the change at the drugstore?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Come along, I&#8217;ll
      get it for you,&#8221; and headed for the restaurant operated by her
      father and mother and her aunt Genevieve Weaver. As we were passing the
      drugstore, she said, &#8220;Get it in here.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, let&#8217;s
      go to the restaurant.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well, bring it to me here&#8221;&#8212;and
      she sat down on a bench. When I gave her the nickel, she skipped across
      the street to the Wells store&#8212;and I went back to the restaurant. In
      a little while she came in with her purchase, grinning. She opened it, and
      proceeded at once to paint her fingernails right before her parents, still
      grinning. Nellie said Cloy had &#8220;deviled&#8221; them for that extra
      nickel to get the nail polish</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">and that they had turned her down. It was plain then why she

      good cheer, said to me, &#8220;You never did let me see in your rooms.&#8221;
      I said, &#8220;Well, come in now and take a good look.&#8221; When inside,

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">These two fine little youngsters have been in my home&#8212;separate
      apartment&#8212;since time began for them. And I&#8217;ve</span> <span></span>
      <span class="c0">instilled in their heads the ice cream cone habit. Their
      mother has told them that they must not ask for the cones&#8212;but
      together we&#8217;ve worked out a way around that. Whenever I meet Karen,
      bright-eyed and smiling, in my path, I say to</span> <span></span> <span
      class="c0">her, &#8220;Well, go in and tell your mother.&#8221; I never
      know how she gets it over to Marjorie&#8212;but we are always off at once,</span>
      <span></span> <span class="c0">usually with a mighty active little trailer
      not far behind. When brought into my presence in the yard, before she
      could talk,</span> <span></span> <span class="c0">Karen, doubtless
      thinking of a cone, would point the way down town and then run ahead for
      about a rod. When this</span> <span></span> <span class="c0">did not bring
      the desired results, she would take me by the hand and lead the way,
      humming like a contented kitten</span> <span></span> <span class="c2 c0">sometimes
      purrs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">When hardly three years old, Karen</span> <span>&#8217;</span>
      <span class="c0">s mother sent her, with an older little girl from across
      the street, on an errand down to Hart</span> <span>&#8217;</span> <span
      class="c0">s store. They both &#8220;fetched up</span> <span>&#8221;</span>
      <span class="c0">at the restaurant where I get my meals. They found me
      &#8220;in</span> <span>&#8221;&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">but Karen,
      in the lead, did not give me so much as a single look. They marched on
      past me, climbed</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">with much
      effort</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">onto the counter
      stools. Charlie Shaffer asked them a couple of times what they wanted</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">but they just stared. Charlie then
      glanced over toward me, laughing, which</span> <span>was equivalent</span>
      <span class="c0">to saying, &#8220;You take &#8216;em,</span> <span>&#8221;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and then I had gotten over my laughing spell, I called
      Karen over to me, and asked her if they would like cones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Her little head went up and down a couple of times. They
      got their cones, and went out pleased. And I was pleased, too.</span>
      <span></span> <span class="c0">When the annual Wetmore Fair was in
      progress I found Karen, slightly more than four years old, sitting primly
      on a bench among strangers at the down-town end of the block on which we
      lived, and I sat down by her. She proudly told me she had on a new dress</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">a little yellow creation&#8212;which
      I later suspected she had been told to keep clean. I told her she looked
      nice&#8212;and this she accepted with true womanly grace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It also developed that she had been permitted to go
      thus far only in advance, to await the coming of her mother and Harry&#8212;but
      she did not take the trouble to tell me this. I asked her to go with me to
      the drugstore for cones. She hesitated a moment as if she were remembering
      something&#8212;and then declined to go, but she said, &#8220;I thank you
      for asking me.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On my return from the post office, I observed the
      little yellow dress was still on the bench&#8212;and, as Karen had been so
      nice about it, I stepped into the drugstore and bought a couple of cones,
      aiming to pick her up on my way home. Then, too late, I realized my
      mistake. The children saw me with the cones as they turned the corner with
      their mother enroute to the program on the Fair grounds in the next block.
      With apologies, I gave the cones to Marjorie, thinking to make her jointly
      responsible for messing up her children.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, the next day when we were getting cones at the
      drugstore, I asked Karen if she had gotten her new dress soiled with the
      cone last evening. Karen laughed&#8212;and said, &#8220;You know
      something. Daddy and mamma ate the cones&#8212;but mamma gave me one bite.&#8221;
      I did not hear from Harry on this score, but assumed matters had been
      properly taken care of. The moral is: Never give a kid a messy treat after
      mama has cleaned it up for public appearance.</span>

      <span class="c9 c0">ANOTHER BRIGHT LITTLE STAR</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The little Fresno, California miss was ushered into my
      presence. My sister then went back outside to continue with the watering
      of her flowers. Standing off at a reasonable distance, Connie Jean Moser,
      from across the street at 1010 Ferger, said, &#8220;Aunt Nannie told me to
      come in and get acquainted with Uncle John.&#8221; Attracted at once by
      the little visitor&#8217;s proud carriage, pleasant expression of face,
      and trim little body not burdened with too many clothes, I told her that
      for me this should be a real pleasure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Little girls, from three to six, in all their
      innocence, have always made a hit with me. This is not to say I do not
      appreciate them when they are older. But in general they lose a lot when
      they get smart. And here now was beauty and apparently innocence at its
      best. A little reserved at first, Connie Jean declined my invitation for
      her to sit with me on the sofa, where I had been writing on a tab. She
      climbed into a chair, twisted, and got settled with her little bare feet
      sticking straight out at me. She told me her name, her age, and where She
      lived&#8212;and that she had a boy friend named David.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Not wanting to lose an interrupted thought, I picked
      up the tab and wrote a few lines. This done, I now found Connie Jean
      Moser, four years old, sitting close up by my side, on the sofa. She asked
      me to read what I had written. I said, &#8220;Oh, Connie, you wouldn&#8217;t
      understand it.&#8221; Then she commanded, peremptorily, &#8220;Read it!&#8221;
      I told her I was writing a book, and if she would promise to read every
      word of it when she got big enough that I would send her the book.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Oh, a book,&#8221; she said, happily, a light
      breaking in upon her understanding, &#8220;I could take it to school like
      Oralee.&#8221; Oralee Johnson, ten years old, is Connie Jean&#8217;s next
      door neighbor. I told Connie that Oralee, when four years old, had paid me
      several rather affectionate visits when I was in Fresno six years ago&#8212;but
      Oralee was getting too big for that now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Oralee is big.</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Connie Jean squirmed and twisted on the sofa, as
      children will, causing the straps sustaining her little sun-suit to slip
      off her shoulders, annoying her to the point of alarm. I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
      let the straps bother you, Connie&#8212;you will not lose your suit.&#8221;
      She smiled, and her blue eyes opened wide. &#8220;If I would lose &#8216;em,&#8221;
      she said, &#8220;it would be too bad&#8212;got nothing under &#8216;em.&#8221;</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A very good man once said, &#8220;Suffer little

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A half century ago England got rid of some of her
      surplus inhabitants by sending them over to this country to &#8220;root
      hog, or die&#8221; as the old saying is. They drifted in here &#8220;like
      lost leaves from the annals of men.&#8221; Colonies were planted in
      numerous sections of Kansas. Nemaha County, with her great sweep of vacant
      rolling prairies, inviting, snared one of those colonies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The settlement known as the old English colony was on
      section twenty-five, in Harrison township, five miles northwest of
      Wetmore. The section was purchased from the Union Pacific railroad company
      by the Co-operative Colonization Company, of London, about 1870.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The London Colonization Company had about six hundred
      members. They drew lots to determine who would be the lucky&#8212;or
      unlucky&#8212;ones to come over first, expenses paid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">John Fuller, John Mollineaux, George Dutch, John
      Radford, Charles McCarthy and John Stowell were the original six to enter
      upon the duties of conquering this land&#8212;virgin wild land it was.
      Except John Stowell, all these men had families, but they did not all
      bring their families over at first.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">An eight-room house was built in the middle of the
      section and all managed to live in it for a while. It was called Llewellyn
      Castle. Later, lean-tos were built on two sides of the big house, and
      finally, some smaller buildings were erected around the original house.
      The men were supplied, meagerly, with funds to equip the farm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The idea of the Company at first was to make a town in
      the center of the section, and cut the land up into 10-acre tracts. They
      seemed to think that ten acres would make a respectable sized farm. The
      town of Goff, a mile and a half away, got started and the Colony town
      project was abandoned. Also the 10-acre farm plan was changed to forty
      acres. The lumber for the improvements was unloaded at old Sother, a
      siding on the railroad a mile and a half south of the Colony section.
      There was a postoffice at old Sother. Nothing else. Not even a station
      agent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Later arrivals of the Colonists included the Wessels,
      Beebys, Perrys, Coxes, Ashtons, Trents, McConwells, G ates, Morden, Hill,
      May, Conover, Weston, Helsby, Weeks, Mrs. Terbit, and others. Still later,
      other members of the Colonization Company come over after the local
      Company had ceased to exist &#8211;gone bankrupt, it was charged, because
      of the extravagant management of the non-producing misfits sent over here
      to start operations. At this late date it could not be ascertained just
      what was the text of the contracts between the parent company and the
      members sent over here. But the impression is that if all had gone well
      additional lands would have been acquired to accommodate other members.
      The members, however, kept on coming regardless of the lack of advance
      preparation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">They scattered out on other lands, mostly around the
      Colony&#8212;usually 40-acre tracts. They were miserably poor. And the
      privations were many. Mrs. Terbit, having no mode of conveyance, used to
      walk all the way in from the Colony and carry home on her shoulder a
      50-pound sack of flour.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Isaac May settled on the 40-acre tract one mile south
      of Wetmore, which is now the home of George W. Gill. May lived in a
      dug-out. John Stowell settled on the north eighty of a quarter five miles
      southwest of Wetmore&#8212;known as the Joe Board place, and still later
      owned by Charley Krack.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">George Cox settled the south eighty, which is still in
      the Cox family&#8212;now owned by George&#8217;s son Fred, of Goff.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Colony project was a glorious and ignominious
      failure from the very first, with romance and intrigue ever in the
      ascendancy. Those poor Englishmen were as green as the verdant prairies of
      springtime that lay all about them. And the inexorable hand of Fate
      pressed down on them heavily. They were besieged by droughts,
      grasshoppers, prairie fires, blizzards, rattlesnakes&#8212;and, worst of
      all, an abiding ignorance of all things American. When Llewellyn Castle
      was torn down in later years, a den of rattlesnakes&#8212;twenty two in
      number&#8212;was found under the house.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Tom Fish told me that the snakes were offer heard
      flopping against the floor, underneath, while the house was occupied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Those poor misfits had not a chance. And it was little
      short of criminal to send them over here so empty handed and so illy
      equipped for the duties imposed upon them. But they were now all a part of
      the big, sun-filled Golden West. And they were too poor to go back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Many are the causes advanced for the downfall of the
      Colony project, but the one cause on which all seem to be unanimous, more
      or less, is that &#8220;They were a bunch of rascals.&#8221; This is
      probably an error&#8212;or partly so, at least.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Internal friction with a very shady but treeless
      background undoubtedly played its part. But I would rather suspect that
      the main cause was ignorance, or to put it more kindly, a lack of
      knowledge. Tom Fish, our faithful mixer of British-American juris-prudence&#8212;three
      times Justice of the Peace backs me up in this contention. Says Tommy,
      &#8220;They just didn&#8217;t knower anythink about farmin.&#8221; Our Tom
      attended their meetings back in London at the Newman street-Market street
      headquarters.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But whatever the facts, and admitting that there were
      among the Colonists no replicas of the man who walked along the Galilean
      shores two thousands years ago, still I do not subscribe to the general
      belief that those Colonists were all rascals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Had they succeeded, handicapped as they were, it would
      have been a miracle&#8212;and only in ancient history do miracles spring
      fullblown from questionable beginnings. A condition soon developed among
      the Colonists on section twenty-five where it was &#8220;every fellow for
      himself and may the devil take the hindmost.&#8221; True, there was a lot
      of poor management and some shady, if not to say crooked, transactions.
      And it appears one man did rather &#8220;Lord&#8221; it over the others&#8212;took
      the lion&#8217;s share of everything.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">George Cox, a carpenter&#8212;they were practically
      all tradesmen was sent over to superintend fencing the Colony lands. And,
      very much to the merriment of the natives, he did that fencing in the dead
      of winter, when the ground was frozen. The postholes he and his countrymen
      dug that winter cost the Company one dollar, each. Such frozen assets
      were, of course, conducive to the downfall of the Company.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But George Cox was not the fool that his ice-bound
      fence would indicate. The real fault was on the other side of the big
      pond. The Company sent Cox over here in midwinter to build a fence. He was
      without funds. The larder at Llewellyn Castle was low&#8212;distressingly
      low. And his brother Englishmen needed immediate succor. There was money
      for George Cox only when he worked. And he couldn&#8217;t afford to put in
      all his time that blizzardy, snowbound winter hanging onto the coat-tail
      of one of his brother countrymen while the bunch of them played
      ring-round-the-stove in that old Colony house to keep from freezing, as he
      once told me he was compelled to do. So, then, what was really wrong with
      George&#8217;s congealed fence idea?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Like other Englishmen, after coming here, George Cox
      had a lot to learn, of course. He was the complainant in a lawsuit
      involving the ownership of a cow. John J. Ingalls was attorney for
      Theodore</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Wolfley, the defendant. The illustrious John J.
      queried, &#8220;What color was your cow, Mr. Cox?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Bay,&#8221; said George. The court laughed, and
      told Cox to try again. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I &#8216;ave
      a bay &#8216;orse, and my cow&#8217;s the same color as my bay &#8216;orse.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, from over the seas, came the jovial Mr. Murray,
      clothed in authority and a superabundance of ego&#8212;English to the
      core. He had been sent over here to make an audit of the Company&#8217;s
      estate. Murray stopped first at Wetmore and partook freely of Johnny
      Clifton&#8217;s &#8220;alf-and-alf.&#8221; He was a free spender and made
      friends here readily.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In pursuance of his duties, Mr. Murray said to those
      Colony delinquents, &#8220;Wots the jolly old idea of all this reticence?
      Hits most happallin! I want to see the books, by-jove.&#8221; One of those
      derelicts exclaimed with a little more mirth than was becoming, &#8220;I-si,
      just listen to &#8216;im, fellow! Wants to see the books, &#8216;e does!
      That&#8217;s rich! Si, mister we don&#8217;t keep henny books!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then in unison they shot words at Mr. Murray which
      were the same as &#8220;You get the hell out of here.&#8221; Murray
      demurred, and not having read the storm signals quite right, he bellowed,
      &#8220;Ave a care! Want that I should report you for this hincolence? Hits
      very hunwise for you to hact this wy!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But when the old shotgun was brought out from its
      hiding place an awful doubt of his own wisdom assailed the jovial Mr.
      Murray. Those true sons of Briton actually chased the auditor away with a
      shotgun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In employing the hit-and-miss English words here I am
      relaying them to you as best I can from memory as I caught them from one,
      maybe two, of the original six, many, many years ago. The quoted words are
      not my own. If you could have known the men and could apply either the
      Stowell or Radford pronunciation and accent you would improve it a lot.
      And don&#8217;t forget to speed up a little.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There are now few of the old-time typical English with
      us. And the language of those who came over a long time ago has become
      Americanized to such extent that the younger generation here have no
      conception of just how delightfully funny was the talk of a fresh
      Englishman. However, some of those who came over as children and Even some
      of the American born who had good tutors retain a percentage Of the
      pronunciation, but the inflection and speed which characterized their
      ancestors have been lost.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After the collapse of the Colony enterprise the
      unallotted part of section twenty-five fell into the hands of Captain
      Wilson, of London.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He was an officer in the Company. Later, Captain
      Wilson&#8217;s interest was acquired by William Fish, also of London, and
      a member of the Company. In England William Fish was superintendent of the
      Great Northern railroad. He came over here in 1881. He was a pensioner,
      and did not renounce his allegiance to the Crown.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Captain Wilson thought a lot of the Colony scheme. He
      was to have given his fortune at death to the first male child born on the
      Colony section. That honor fell to Alfred Wilson Mollineaux, first son of
      John Mollineaux, born 1874. While conversing with Alfred Mollineaux a few
      days ago, he said to me, &#8220;But since I didn&#8217;t get me &#8216;eritage
      I&#8217;ve dropped the Wilson part of it. Wot would be the good to bother
      with it now?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Mollineaux heirs are the only descendents of the
      originals holding an interest in section twenty-five in recent years.
      Alfred now owns the south 80 of the northwest quarter. Harry sold the
      north 80 two years ago to Otto Krack. Otto paid $6,000 for it, including
      the growing crop. The old house on the place, built more than a half
      century ago, is the original John Mollineaux home. The other lands in the
      section have long since passed to new owners.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There are now only two of the old Colonists living.
      William Wessel, familiarly called &#8220;Teddy,&#8221; came over in 1873.
      He is 89, and lives with his daughter, Mrs. John Chase, in Goff. William
      Conover lives with his son Edward, on a farm adjacent to the old Colony
      section. He is 89.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I took a drive about the old Colony section a few days
      ago seeking to refresh my memory and gather additional data for this
      article. At Goff I found Teddy Wessel in the Sourk drug store. Still
      living over the broken dreams of the past, Teddy exploded, first-off,
      &#8220;They were a bunch of damned rascals.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In course of the interview I asked Teddy if he knew
      anything about a racy romance at Llewellyn Castle many years ago. &#8220;I
      should say I do,&#8221; he said. He had a momentary flash of it. That was
      all. Then his mind began to fag. Laboriously, tantalizingly, the tired
      feelers of his mind went fumbling into the dark pool of the past, trying
      desperately to capture the lost details, but the whole works went under&#8212;ebbed
      away like a fadeout in a movie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">George Sourk, who was sitting by and coaching the old
      fellow a bit, said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to give daddy a little time,
      John. He&#8217;ll remember it all right.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Daddy swam up out of it all right and sure enough
      recollections were upon him with a bang. But the main topic was still
      submerged and in its place was an ugly memory that should have been dead
      long ago. &#8220;They were damned rascals,&#8221; is all he said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is assumed that my very fine old friend&#8217;s
      poisoned arrow was aimed only at the shades of the original six, or, at
      most, only those who had the actual management of the Colony affairs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Teddy Wessel&#8217;s run of hard luck started before
      he left London. It seems he bought something&#8212;or thought he paid for
      something&#8212;he didn&#8217;t get. But Teddy can thank his stars that
      there was at least one crooked countryman in his close circle. Teddy
      trusted a friend to purchase first-class passagenfor himself and family.
      The friend bought cheaper tickets on a slower ship, and pocketed the
      difference. The fast ship passed the slower one in mid-ocean and was lost,
      together with all on board, when one day out from New York.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A happy&#8212;and I believe equitable&#8212;solution
      of the matter would allow the reader who had a friend or relative among
      them the privilege of exempting such one, and thus still leave Teddy some
      targets for his arrows. For my own part, I think I should like to exempt
      that little nineteen-year-old boy, John Stowell. In later years, after he
      had come to Wetmore and engaged in business, I worked for John Stowell in
      his lumber yard, and in his brick manufacturing plant, and finally, as
      type-setter on his newspaper. He was not a crook.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I grew up along with those bally English and I think I
      knew them pretty well. They were not all rascals. The Colony section was
      only five miles away from Wetmore as the crow flies. And as the crow flew
      then so did I gallop my mustang along the prairie grass lane while
      carrying mail between Wetmore and Seneca, passing Llewellyn Castle on the
      way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There were few fences in the way then. Just prairie
      grass and wild roses and more prairie grass. And lots of prairie chickens.
      I have seen acres of them at one time on the hillsides in the vicinity of
      Llewellyn Castle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was no blue-grass then. And no timber along the
      route anywhere until the Nemaha was reached just this side of Seneca, at
      the old Hazzard place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And later, in 1887, when I was a compositor on T. J.
      Wolfley&#8217;s Seneca Tribune, and made drives home with Sandy Sterling&#8217;s
      livery team, practically all of the twenty-six miles of road was still
      only a winding trail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Willis J. Coburn, the contractor for that Star mail
      route, went with me on the first trip. He took me to the home of his old
      friend, John Radford, who had then left the Colony and was living on the
      old Scrafford place adjoining Seneca on the south. I put up with &#8220;Old
      Radidad&#8221;&#8212;as we afterwards called him when he came to live in
      Wetmore&#8212;for about a month, and while they treated me kindly, I didn&#8217;t
      like their English ways.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And when I announced my intentions of throwing up my
      job Willis Coburn said I should then put up at the old Fairchild Hotel,
      which was on a side street north from the upper end of the main street. It
      was a stone building. Besides being immaculately clean, the Fairchilds
      were related to the Jay Powers family in Wetmore and that made a bond
      between us that held for the duration of my mail carrying activities.
      There were two stops on the way&#8212;one in the Abbey neighborhood, and
      one at old Lincoln.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As compensation for my services as mail-carrier, I was
      paid fifty cents each way, up one day and back the next&#8212;twice a
      week. And I was glad to get that. Our mail-carriers here in Wetmore,
      covering about equal distance, with only two hours on the road, draw about
      seven dollars a day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Willis Coburn offered me the job I was short of
      the required age, sixteen, and I was wondering how I would get by without
      swearing to a lie, when our good old postmaster, Alvin McCreery, solved
      the problem for me. When he swore me in, he said, &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t
      tell me your age.&#8221; He shook his head, negatively, and repeated,
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me your age.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the Radford home in Seneca, I learned enough about
      the old Colony to make a book, but much of it is now shrouded in a fog of
      haze. On the occasion of our first trip, Mr. Radford and Mr. Coburn
      discussed Colony matters freely in my presence. It was July, and it was
      out on the border of the big orchard which came right up to the back door,
      under the shade of an early harvest apple tree, where they sat and talked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I have to admit that at the time I was more interested
      in the golden fruit hanging on the apple tree than I was in the
      conversation, but I got enough of it to know that there would be a good
      story in it, if I could but remember more clearly. Mr. Radford&#8217;s
      agile mind ground out astonishing facts as steadily as a grist mill that
      afternoon. Whatever else may be said of John Radford, he was an educated
      man. And he had a wonderful sense of humor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As I remember it, or partly remember it, the high
      light of the afternoon&#8217;s conversation&#8212;the thing that tickled
      the men most&#8212;was a racy romance that had budded, bloomed, and died
      at Llewellyn Castle. The male participants were of course Wetmore men&#8212;one
      artisan, one professional. But somewhere along the time-worn trail between
      that old apple tree and my present quarters, separated by three and fifty
      years, the details of that affair are lost. And like the characters who
      made it, that romance has crumbled into dust&#8212;is now a part of the
      past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the phantom of the bally old thing, elusive though
      as a half-formed thought awakened by a stray wisp of forgotten fragrance,
      still hovers over section twenty-five. And if memory were but a trifle
      more elastic I could entertain you with something more than the tattered
      shreds of Llewellyn Castle&#8217;s most charming romance&#8212;a jolly old
      love-spree staged and destroyed by the heartless hand of Fate.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Colony folk, men and women, came to Wetmore to do
      their trading&#8212;and to sip &#8216;alf-an-&#8217;alf, beer and whisky.
      At that time there was quite a lot of immigration from England, and
      Britons were scattered about over the prairies in all directions&#8212;and
      in general they were all regarded as Colonists.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">William Cawood, with his two sons, Walter and Prince,
      came direct to Wetmore from Scarborough, England, in the spring of 1870.
      Other members of the family&#8212;George, Charley, Emma, Kate, and their
      mother&#8212;followed in the fall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">William Cawood was a large man&#8212;a man of means, a
      man of dignity, ideas, and mutton-chops. In England he was a contractor
      and builder&#8212;and a good one, too, it was said. Here, he built his
      meat-market, and his residence, his horse stable, his cow barn, and his
      pig sty, all under one roof. The structure, founded upon pine studding set
      in the ground, was on the alley end of four lots north of Third Street and
      west of Kansas Avenue. The boys at school across the street to the east
      thought a new telegraph line was coming to town. In later years, wondering
      if my memory had served me well, I asked Prince Cawood if it were true
      that those studding were set in the ground? He said, &#8220;Every one of
      them.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Walter Cawood was a large man like his father. He
      played an important part in the making of this story&#8212;or rather this
      incident. An outstanding episode of the early days was a free-for-all
      fight on the main street in Wetmore, with Colonists predominating. It was
      the year 1870&#8212;maybe 1871. Can&#8217;t be sure about the exact time.
      That brawl is recorded in local history as &#8220;English Boxing Day&#8221;&#8212;though
      in England, the day after Christmas is known as Boxing Day, This one
      occurred on a muggy summer day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At this time Wetmore&#8217;s main street was flanked with
      three buildings on the south side, and four on the north side, in blocks
      one and four&#8212;all well toward the west end. Lush</span> <span
      class="c11"></span> <span class="c2 c0">prairie grass still grew on the
      east half of those two blocks. A long hitchrack was in the center of the
      ungraded street.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I do not recall what it was that started the fight.
      Perhaps it was the old Colony hatred, refreshed by drink. Those Colonists
      were continually fussing among themselves. A little fellow with a piping
      voice&#8212;I think it might have been Bilby&#8212;led off by striking a
      brother Englishman on the mug. He yelled, &#8220;Tike that, you bloody
      blighter!&#8221; They were on the south side of the street in front of
      John Clifton&#8217;s saloon. The little fellow started to run away. He
      dodged under the hitchrack and stumbled in the street almost in front of
      my father&#8217;s shoeshop on the north side. The big man who had taken
      the rap on the face was soon upon the little runt. Then multitudinous
      inebriated Englishmen, and at least one German&#8212;Bill Liebig&#8212;fell
      in without waiting for an invitation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was a battle royal&#8212;everybody hitting
      somebody, anybody. Blood and blasphemous epithets, in awkward delivery,
      flowed freely. When the battle had run its course a dozen men, maybe more,
      were prone upon the ground. A stocky little woman came out of the saloon
      and met the bruised and bleeding aggressor. &#8220;Hi &#8216;opes,&#8221;
      she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re now sart-isfied&#8212;my cocky little man.
      Been spoilin&#8217; for a fight this long time.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Walter Cawood appeared to be the big shot of that
      melee. He was young, powerful, and extremely handy with his fists. Those
      tipsy brawlers went down before his punches as if they were babies. Walter
      was the big shot in one more unsavory mixup&#8212;it really stunk&#8212;before
      going back to his dear old England to stay. Single handed, he captured a
      whole family of half-grown skunks. He brought them home for pets, with the
      view of taking them back to England with him. - Walter said, &#8220;Aw,
      blemmy&#8212;the bloody little ones, they -ad been eatin&#8217; on summick
      quite putrid.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The next best skunk collector of that time also was a
      Britisher. Teddy Masters, a diminutive Englishman who was farming the Jim
      Noyes place over on the county line, with a man named Briggs, chanced to
      be helping with the threshing on the John Thornburrow farm, when it rained
      and stopped the work. Three of the threshing crew&#8212;Irve Hudson, Ice
      Gentry, and &#8220;Zip&#8221; Bean&#8212;with Teddy, came to town in a
      spring wagon. On the way in they saw a skunk by the roadside. One of the
      men told Teddy to jump out and catch it&#8212;that skunks made fine pets.
      He carried the skunk to town in his hat. Someone told Masters that Dr.
      John W. Graham would pay well for that skunk. &#8220;Er, rippin&#8217;,&#8221;
      said the diminutive Englishman. &#8220;A chawnset to grab a little lunch,
      rine or shine, eh? Could do myself well wiv a bob now.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dr. J. W. Graham owned a drugstore on the south side
      of the street. He also owned a fine bird-dog named York. They were nearly
      always together. With the skunk still in his hat, Teddy found Graham&#8217;s
      door locked. Someone across the street told him to throw the skunk in at
      an open window. He did so. A little later, on entering the store, Dr. John
      W. sat himself down to work out some materia medica puzzles, sniffing a
      little on the side, while York was nosing about a bit. When the dog found
      the object of his search, a rising young physician literally exploded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Teddy did not wait to collect his bob.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Though John Stowell, the boy member of the original
      influx of Colonists, did command me&#8212;I was in his employ at the time&#8212;to
      go out on a chicken foraging expedition one bright moonlight night,
      neither he nor I was troubled with conscientious scruples. We were both
      quite sure that we would never have to answer to God or man for our
      actions</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">I hasten to say,
      in this particular instance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Also, if Will Gill and Augustus Anderson were here they
      would tell you that they not only saw me enter a closed but unlocked
      chicken house and come out with six chickens, two at a time, and that they
      themselves helped me carry those chickens to the rendezvous where they
      were to be roasted</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">innards,
      feathers and all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In explanation, John Stowell &#8220;burned&#8221; the
      brick for his two-story building across the street from the Worthy lumber
      office&#8212;the present location of the Catholic recreation hall. The
      brickyard was on Stowell&#8217;s land south of the creek just west of the
      town bridge. Old Hagen, an experienced brick-maker, was brought here to
      burn brick for the John Spencer building&#8212;with Masonic hall above&#8212;on
      the alley south of second street, facing on Kansas Avenue; and the Ed
      Vilott building on the alley south of the present McDaniel picture show
      location, also facing on Kansas Avenue. For these two buildings, Hagen
      burned two kilns of brick on the north side of the creek, west from the
      mineral spring, on the present Don Cole land.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My brother Sam and I worked on the Hagen brickyard</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and learned a few tricks. John
      Stowell said he believed we could do the brick-making as well as Hagen,
      and if we were willing to tackle the job he would &#8220;chawnsit.&#8221;
      Sam did the moulding, and I did the off-bearing, carried the green brick
      to the drying yard&#8212;the same positions we held on the Hagen yard.
      Together we set the brick in the kiln for burning. And we plastered the
      kiln, top and sides, with mud before starting the fires.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The material used in both yards was common top-soil
      mixed with sand&#8212;ground in a horse-propelled mill. Sand for the Hagen
      yard came from a pit about where Frank White&#8217;s barn-lot is, across
      the street from his residence. Sand for the Stowell yard came from a pit
      on the north side of the quarter section at the northeast corner of town.
      It was a treacherous pit. It caved in one time between loads when I was
      hauling&#8212;and it frightened me so badly that I drove back empty. And
      never again did I go into that pit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Incidentally, I may say that it was claimed later a
      good brick-clay was found on the John Thomas farm, a half mile east of
      town. A promoter made the discovery. He planned to build a brick
      manufacturing plant at the point of discovery, and have a railroad spur
      run out from town&#8212;provided, however, that the town people foot the
      bill. Also he wanted to sell his expert knowledge at a ridiculously high
      figure. When it was pointed out to him that a couple of &#8220;greenhorn&#8221;
      boys had made fairly good brick from ordinary dirt, without financial
      sweetening, he gave up the venture.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At the Stowell yard I had the day shift and Sam headed
      the night shift during the burning procedure. For fuel we used old fence
      rails&#8212;mostly. And it took a lot of them. Rails fed into the five
      16-foot fire tunnels to better advantage than any other wood that could be
      had. Wherever so many rails came from I do not recall. Likely from farms
      whose owners were making the change over from the old worm-fence to barbed
      wire, which came along about that time. Besides the firemen&#8212;three to
      the 12-hour shift</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">there
      were always crowds of spectators at the yard, in the early evenings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Stowell was feeling pretty good over the splendid
      progress we were making, and he said to me one evening, out loud so that
      all could hear, &#8220;I think we ought to give the boys a chicken roast
      tonight.&#8221; Then, to the crowd, &#8220;Wot you say, fellows? &#8216;Ere
      two of you boys go along with John and bring back a &#8216;alf dozen
      chicks&#8212;I command John to go.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Will Gill and Gus Anderson fell in with me. The boys
      named a place in the north part of town where they thought we might get
      the chickens without incurring too much risk of being caught. We were now
      passing John Stowell&#8217;s home on the corner where Cleve Battin lives.
      I said, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s too far. Why not see what Laura (Stowell&#8217;s
      wife) has in her chicken house here on the alley?&#8221; Will Gill said,
      &#8220;Why, this is Stowell&#8217;s place. We ought not steal his
      chickens. He might recognize them&#8212;and that would spoil all the fun.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And, by-golly, those two boys refused to put foot on the
      Stowell lot&#8212;and I had to do all the dirty work. I couldn&#8217;t
      blame them though, because it was bright moonlight and the door of the
      chicken house faced the Stowell residence only a few rods to the south.
      But it was, probably, just as well. They wouldn&#8217;t have known where
      to find the choice chicks, anyway. And besides, I knew that, let &#8216;em
      squawk, Laura and the children were going to stay put. Back at the yard,
      the word got around that we had stolen Stowell&#8217;s chickens</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and the whole gang broke into a
      &#8220;Chessy-cat&#8221; grin which didn&#8217;t come off during the whole
      evening. Stowell busied himself with the roasting, without outward signs
      of recognizing a chick.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">John Stowell was very methodical and punctual in the
      conduct of his newspaper. He was reasonable in his demands of his help&#8212;and
      mighty fine fellow to work for. He often paid me extra when particularly
      pleased with our accomplishment. He insisted only that the forms be closed
      by six o&#8217;clock on press days. We usually printed the paper after
      supper, so that Stowell might address the papers for mailing&#8212;and
      then, too, in the winter, we could get a better print while the office was
      warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One time Stowell brought a roving printer upstairs to
      the composing room, having promised the fellow $5 to show me how to print
      in two colors from a solid cut. I told John that I thought I knew how it
      was done. He said, &#8220;By-jingo, maybe you can learn something, anyway.&#8221;
      Turning to the two-color man, he said, &#8220;Show &#8216;im, Mister.&#8221;
      But it was I who did the showing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I looked up a cut of our then new frame school house</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">a carry over from another
      ownership&#8212;and explained how I had printed the building in brown, the
      yard in green, and the sky in blue, with a fleecy white cloud overhead in
      the background, all done with three impressions, from the solid cut.
      Stowell said, &#8216;&#8220;Ere, Mister, &#8216;ere&#8217;s your five
      dollars.&#8221; The fellow said, &#8220;I think you ought to give this to
      your printer&#8212;he&#8217;s gone me one better in the matter of colors.&#8221;
      Stowell said, &#8220;&#8216;Ere John, I&#8217;ll give you $5 too. It&#8217;s
      been worth it to me.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I think you ought to give
      this one to my brother Sam. He engraved the wood cut, showed me how to mix
      colors, and was helpful in figuring out a way to print it in three colors.&#8221;
      Sam was the artist in our family. Stowell said, &#8220;By-jingo, I&#8217;ll
      give &#8216;im $5 too. &#8216;Ow&#8217;s our supply of boxwood?&#8221; He
      had another three-color print in mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At the time of this episode, I had only one helper</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Stowell&#8217;s sixteen-year-old
      daughter, Alice. Alex Hamel and John Kenoyer, part time type-setters, were
      not working that week. Alice was that sort of girl who would do pretty
      much as she pleased so long as her papa would stay downstairs and attend
      strictly to his editorial, and his hardware business.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This day Stowell stayed downstairs until the thing
      happened&#8212;then he rushed from the editorial office on the first floor
      in front, eighty feet back to the rear, then up the stairs to the second
      floor, and back again eighty feet to the composing room. Alice, who knew
      her father better than I did, whispered, &#8220;Oh, Lordy, he&#8217;s mad
      as a wet hen. Don&#8217;t give me away, please!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">John wanted to know, &#8220;Oo was it that &#8216;ad
      offended little Miss &#8216;Utch?&#8221; Neither of us had the answer.
      Coral Hutchison, a frequent and I may say most welcome caller&#8212;preferably
      on any day but Thursday&#8212;and Alice had put in a couple of hours
      visiting, as young girls will. And this was Thursday afternoon, our press
      day. I asked Alice to speed up her work a little so that we might make the
      deadline before six o&#8217;clock. It did no good. I had to speak to Alice
      a second time, not harshly, however&#8212;and Coral, apparently
      understanding the situation, left. But when she passed the editorial
      office downstairs, Stowell said she was crying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After John Stowell had gone downstairs that day, Alice
      said, &#8220;If he asks you again&#8212;and I know he will&#8212;tell him
      what you told me about Coral after she had been up here last week. That
      would tickle him, and he will forget all about her tears.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, John Stowell did ask me again. He really wanted
      to know. And I told him, shielding Alice as much as I could. He said,
      &#8220;I understand. You did right. Make &#8216;er pay attention to
      &#8216;er work. But I just didn&#8217;t like to see a nice girl like
      little Miss &#8216;Utch leaving my place of business, crying.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I squared myself with John by saying&#8212;and meaning</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">that it would be a grievously
      short-sighted thing for any young fellow to knowingly offend &#8220;Little
      Miss &#8216;Utch. Besides being &#8220;some&#8221; girl, she would likely
      some day be an heiress. But, then, even so, this fact was something less
      than a comforting thought to one very fine young local merchant who
      fancied himself well entrenched in her future matrimonial plans. When he
      began talking about what they could accomplish with her papa&#8217;s
      wealth&#8212;she quit him, cold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Little Miss &#8216;Utch&#8221; was the daughter
      of Charley Hutchison, but everybody except Stowell called him &#8220;Hutch.&#8221;
      I knew Charley quite intimately for a dozen years before I learned that
      his name was really Hutchison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">What I had told Alice about Coral that day is not in
      itself worth repeating here. But it offers a chance to introduce an
      outstanding success story&#8212;a success in the redemption of waning
      manhood, as well as in a financial way. Also, this injection does not
      strictly belong in this story</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but, in line with my adopted hop, skip, and jump reminiscing
      technique, I shall try to make it fit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I told Alice that Coral was the only girl who had ever
      asked me to come and see her sometime when her papa wasn&#8217;t around.
      And I might say she was in deadly earnest about this. Her papa would not
      permit her to entertain me in the manner she had in mind. It was not that
      he disapproved of me. In fact, it was on his invitation that I was in the
      presence of the girl at the moment. Also, her papa was at the time just
      outside the hearing of the conspirators.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My brother Charley, Clifford Ashton, and I, were cutting
      sumac for my father&#8217;s tanyard on the Hutchison land south of the big
      barn. Charley Hutchison had followed his four-year-old daughter out to the
      barn that day to prevent her from going through her stunt&#8212;the thing
      she wanted me to witness. Charley saw us in the sumac patch, and came out,
      bringing Coral with him. He said he had a big watermelon patch close to
      the barn, and invited us to help ourselves to the melons&#8212;then, and
      thereafter whenever working in the vicinity. He also said he had to watch
      Coral closely</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">that whenever
      she would get the chance she&#8217;d climb up to the beams in the big barn
      and jump off into the hay. Hay hands were bringing in the harvest at that
      time</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and of course the
      barn was opened up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Bees were buzzing around broken melons in the patch, and
      the little girl, apparently frightened of them, tried to hide her face
      against my legs. Charley said that while they</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">the father, mother, and child&#8212;were visiting his
      people in Ohio, after having attended the Centennial (1876) in
      Philadelphia, Coral had sat down on a &#8220;live&#8221; beehive and got
      stung so badly as to make her very sick; the swelling in her face almost
      closing her eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Hutchison&#8217;s father was a wealthy brewer
      back in Ohio. Charley acquired the drink habit. When his family thought
      they had him shut off from the liquor supply, he would sneak into the
      storage cellar, bore a hole in a whisky barrel, and suck the stuff out
      through a straw.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley was sent out here, in the hope of curing him
      of the drink habit. He was given a section of land on Wolfley creek, three
      miles northwest of Wetmore&#8212;and supplied with money to improve the
      land. I think he was then left wholly on his own. I do not recall ever
      seeing any of his people out here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Hutchison came here in 1870, and was about 21
      years old&#8212;a modest, likeable young man. He spent most of his first
      year here, in town. He lived at the Hugh Fortner Hotel&#8212;and while
      rooming there, lost $500, which he had placed under his pillow. There was
      no bank here then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Charley loafed downtown&#8212;which was much of
      the time that first year&#8212;he made my father&#8217;s shoeshop his
      headquarters. The shop was on the north side of the main street, opposite
      John Clifton&#8217;s saloon on the south side. Charley was really trying
      to taper off in his drinking, and seldom entered the saloon. He tried to
      avoid the amenities of the drinking gentry. He would sometimes, when
      alone, take one drink, and then come across to the shoeshop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Though not a relative of ours, John Clifton was the
      step-son of my Uncle Nick Bristow, and he often dropped in at the
      shoeshop. My mother worked with my father in the shop. She asked John
      Clifton to not encourage Charley in his drinking. Clifton said &#8220;Hutch&#8221;
      was really doing fine, and that he would help the boy all that he could.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then a girl came down from the prairie country in the
      neighborhood of what is now Goff&#8212;&#8221;Pucker Brush&#8221; it was
      called then&#8212;to work in Peter Shuemaker&#8217;s new hotel. Anna
      Mackey was a nice looking girl&#8212;too nice looking, Charley said, to go
      out with the landlord&#8217;s &#8220;drunken&#8221; son. It really worried
      Charley. He said one day, &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll try to stop it.&#8221;
      He did. He married Anna. And never again did he take a drink. My mother
      and Clifton both took credit for helping him over the hump. But I suspect
      it was the girl from the prairie country who had transformed him short off
      into an abstainer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Hutchison was the only one of several whom I
      knew that were sent out here from the east, when this country was new, for
      a like purpose, that made good. There was no finer man than Charley
      Hutchison&#8212;a conscientious, upright Christian gentleman. Compared to
      &#8220;Jersey&#8221; Campbell, a New Jersey drinking boy, located on the
      best half section of land south of Goff, Charley Hutchison&#8217;s
      performance was phenomenal. But then, maybe there never was an &#8220;Anna&#8221;
      in Jersey&#8217;s life. Charley Hutchison sold his land to Fred Shumaker,
      and moved to Wetmore in the early eighties. He built the home now owned by
      Mrs. James Grubb.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Let me say here that Alice Stowell was an attentive
      little type-setter when she worked for me after I had bought The Spectator&#8212;and
      that Coral Hutchison still was a frequent and most welcome caller. Also,
      they had learned that it was important that visitors be seen and not heard
      on press days. Coral continued her visits to the office long after Alice
      Stowell had married Marsh Younkman, and moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma&#8212;and
      after Myrtle Mercer had taken Alice&#8217;s place in the printing office.
      Coral seemed to like the smell of printer&#8217;s ink&#8212;and she
      continued her regular visits long after she married Charley Locknane.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While still quite young, Coral Hutchison was the town&#8217;s
      top pianist and singer, a distinction she held throughout the years
      against all comers. She even competed favorably, in song, with the girls
      from the Colony, whose reputation as singers was widespread. The younger
      generation of Colonists were superb entertainers, anxious at all times to
      compete against or team up with the young people from town, at their
      lyceums held in the Wolfley school house. Wetmore had a &#8220;literary&#8221;
      society, which gave entertainments, usually charging twenty-five cents
      admission&#8212;while the Colonists always gave their shows for free.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, the time came when they combined in one big
      show, an epochal achievement, at Wetmore&#8212;drawing two of the cast
      from the Colony. Ted Fish was a specialty man, singing comical songs. His
      favorite rendition had to do with the loan of a friend&#8217;s girl, the
      refrain running, &#8220;Hand &#8216;e wounted me to tike &#8216;is plice
      and do the best I cooud.&#8221; I&#8217;d heard him sing it several times
      before at their lyceums. Coral Hutchison was also a specialty singer&#8212;on
      a much higher and more pleasing musical plane, however. John Stowell, long
      removed from the Colony, blacked his face, rattled the bones&#8212;and
      played the concertina.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Bill Dutch, of the Colony, was leading man</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and a mighty good one too. Our own Miss Jane Thomas
      was leading lady&#8212;equally good. The play was a &#8220;heavy&#8221;
      drama. I might say the whole cast except myself, was exceptionally good.
      As to my own part, you shall be the judge. It was not a speaking part.
      Months before this, I had blundered in a speaking part on the stage&#8212;carelessly
      called a word what, by all the ethics of decency, it should not have been
      called. It provoked uproarious laughter&#8212;at my expense. And on a
      subsequent appearance upon the literary stage I drew a concerted giggle
      before I even had time to open my mouth. It completely unnerved me&#8212;for
      all time. I was so &#8220;befuddled&#8221; that I couldn&#8217;t say a
      word, and I didn&#8217;t have the gumption to graciously bow myself off
      the stage. I bolted off. And that&#8217;s how I became a writer. It&#8217;s
      safest, anyhow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When you blunder, you can always&#8212;if smart enough
      to detect it&#8212;scratch it out. But spoken words, once said, can never
      be recalled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The director, &#8220;Lord&#8221; Richard Bingham, was an
      Englishman</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">not related, and
      unknown to the Colonists&#8212;who had dropped in here from, nobody knew
      where, or why. He seemed to have a perpetual thirst for strong drink&#8212;and
      the money with which to provide it. He was a remittance man</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">which is to say he was a scion of a wealthy old
      country family, sent over here on a monthly allowance, as riddance of a
      costly nuisance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Director Bingham was apparently well educated, did not
      talk the &#8220;Cockney&#8221; language of the Colonists</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and had some dramatic ability. He directed this
      home-talent show without pay&#8212;and did a pretty good job of it. All he
      asked was a &#8220;little more McBriar,&#8221; his favorite brand of
      whisky. And after he had &#8220;steamed up&#8221; on a generous quantity
      of the nameless stuff from the local</span> <span></span> <span
      class="c2 c0">&#8220;speak-easy&#8221;&#8212;licensed saloons were out
      here then&#8212;anything and everything was &#8220;good old McBriar.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The show went over so well in Wetmore that the
      management decided to repeat it at Capioma&#8212;and maybe go on the road
      with it. But, in the nick of time, it was recalled that Henry
      Clinkenbeard, our photographer&#8212;or rather our taker of daguerreotypes&#8212;had
      sponsored an all home-talent minstrel show which also had gone over big
      here, but when tried out on the road, proved a financial failure&#8212;and
      the road idea was written off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">All due to an outburst of alcoholic conviviality, Mr.
      Bingham saluted Miss Jane on the takeoff for Capioma, assuring her that
      she would not fail to &#8220;knock &#8216;em cold.&#8221; He did not go
      with the show. The management willed that he remain in Wetmore where he
      could have ready access to Charley McCarthy&#8217;s &#8220;blind-tiger&#8221;
      and enjoy to the full &#8220;a little more&#8221; of his favorite &#8220;McBriar.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The day of our Capioma appearance was cold. There was
      bright sunshine, with a foot of snow on the ground. The whole cast&#8212;including
      Henry Clinkenbeard and his brass band&#8212;went in several lumber wagons,
      arriving in Capioma in time for supper at the Van Brunt farm home. I
      believe his name was Jerry. Anyway, he was the father of Tunis and Teeny.
      The show was held in the hall over the Van Pelt store, in town, diagonally
      across the road west from the Van Brunt farm home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I was taken along as assistant property man</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and doubled in brass (b-flat cornet)&#8212;but the
      cramped space for stage and dressing rooms in the rather small Van Pelt
      hall developed a better spot for me. I was made the custodian of the
      leading lady&#8217;s train&#8212;carried it in my two hands just so from
      dressing room around sharp turns to the stage, and paid out its many
      folds, at entrance, in a manner to avoid entanglement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The twelve mile ride in open wagon, with bright sunshine
      bearing down on the reflecting white snow, had done things to the girls&#8217;
      faces. However, the wise ones had fetched along cosmetics to make
      themselves presentable</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      our leading lady said she never had, and by the eternal bonds of
      respectability, she never would use make-up. Although conceded to be the
      privilege of stage-women, nice girls didn&#8217;t paint their faces in
      that period. And although our Jane did eventually make Hollywood, I
      suspect the day never came when she would use make-up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Though a native of Wales, with maybe a dozen years in
      this country at that time, Jane Thomas did not retain, markedly, the old
      country manner of speech. She was endowed with a delightful little twist,
      all her own&#8212;that is, something apart from that of other members of
      her family, which was neither Welsh nor pure English. Jane was a pretty
      girl. Her slight elegant body, draped in silk with something like six feet
      of the train trailing in the wake as she moved majestically across the
      stage, gave her a queenly quality. And she still looked lovely despite her
      shiny nose. She was, or rather had been before his demise, my brother
      Charley&#8217;s girl.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In glancing over the current issue of The
      Courier-Tribune I notice that the good citizens of Seneca are putting on a
      Biblical show this week. That&#8217;s fine. Whenever I hear of home talent
      aspiring to portray those ancient characters on the stage I become
      interested right away. It recalls to mind the time when I myself was,
      briefly, in the cast of a local entertainment of that sort held in the old
      school house here in Wetmore many, many years ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was a show the likes of which Wetmore had never had
      before, nor since&#8212;a show that stands out in memory as the one
      classic of the times&#8212;a show that rocked the whole countryside,
      rocked it with near volcanic convulsions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Considering the extraordinary performers and the
      conduct of an audience which ran wild, this little review is not offered
      as something worthy of emulation. Nor is it to be construed as criticism.
      Rather, it is something to be contrasted with the newer interpretations
      and renditions, something to be compared with present-day reactions as
      against old-time unbridled responses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">As aforesaid, with other local talent&#8212;grownups, and
      some lesser lights, including an injection of members of &#8220;that
      tanyard gang&#8221;&#8212;I was cast for a minor part in that show. To
      give you the right slant on this last mentioned group of my theatrical
      co-workers, I should say here that my father operated a tannery in the old
      days, and &#8220;the gang&#8221;</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">frequenters of the yard&#8212;included just about all the
      happy-go-lucky youth of the town, vividly alive, and callow. Collectively,
      we made quite a record&#8212;something short of enviable, it now pains me
      to relate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was my dear old Sunday School superintendent who
      had selected me for one of her characters in this Biblical show. I had
      been marvelous&#8212;so she said&#8212;in her Sunday School, committing
      and reciting as many as twenty Bible verses on a Sunday morning, for which
      I would sometimes be given a little up-lift card. She said that my good
      work in her Sunday School was guarantee enough for her that I would handle
      the part assigned me creditably. I would not need to attend rehearsals.
      All that I should do was to have my good mother make for me a
      heterogeneous coat according to specifications. She would instruct me at
      the last minute so that I wouldn&#8217;t forget.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I was to take the part of Joseph&#8212;Joseph, the boy.
      And, although a bit irregular, and I might say diabolically devised, to
      save the stage-carpenter the trouble of making a pit to cast me into, one
      of my Hebrew brothers&#8212;I think it would have been Judah, who, off
      stage, was a big Swede</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">was
      to have batted me on the &#8220;bean&#8221; so that I couldn&#8217;t
      protest when he and my other naughty brothers would sell me to the
      Egyptians, and thus banish me to the Land of Bondage. I wouldn&#8217;t
      need to rehearse? Oh, no, of course not! And as it turned out I didn&#8217;t
      perform, either.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The show was going strong. The audience applauded and
      yelled itself hoarse. After a particularly exciting scene, Rolland Van
      Amburg, the town clown, jumped up from his seat and yelled, &#8220;It&#8217;s
      the best thing Wetmore ever had&#8212;I&#8217;ve had my money&#8217;s
      worth already! Come and get another quarter!&#8221; Van was ably assisted
      in this demonstration by one William Morris, leading merchant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The sponsoring lady was in high glee&#8212;happy daze.
      She said to her puppets, &#8220;It&#8217;s taking! Oh, dear children, we
      must give them this one again!&#8221; She flitted about from one to
      another, saying, &#8220;Oh, girls, please do hurry!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The scene which had so excited Van was a tableau
      draped in naught but thin mosquito bar and set off by the best soft
      mellowing light effect that could be had with the oil-burning lamps,
      depicting some Biblical event with strictly private and as time goes quite
      modern interpretations. Embroidered beyond the original concept, it
      exhibited in silhouette some of Wetmore&#8217;s fairest damsels&#8212;some
      who will read this and blush&#8212;in an amazing state of dishabille. I
      should like to&#8212;and probably will&#8212;hear from Montana and Idaho,
      and even faraway Hollywood, on this statement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A wag in the audience who was not man enough to show
      himself, like Van, yelled, &#8220;Take down the bars!&#8221; The audience
      roared! The sponsoring lady beamed! Things got to going so good for the
      director that she began pulling surprises on the performers. Wholly
      without warning, she ordered Clifford Ashton to take off his shirt. That
      young Englishman, ever obliging and obedient, had about completed the job
      when Dr. Thomas Milam cried out in his most dramatic voice, &#8220;Put
      that shirt back on, you idiot!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The woman, who was my Sunday School superintendent,
      overhearing the Doctor&#8217;s remark, forthwith gave another curt
      command: &#8220;Off with that shirt, Clifford&#8212;off with that shirt!&#8221;
      The voice carried, full and resonant, through the calico partitions to the
      rear of the auditorium. That command became a phrase which was hurled at
      Clifford as long as he lived here. He is now in Seattle, Washington.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As already stated, I was to have taken the part of
      Joseph. I had a sort of vague idea that my beautiful coat of variegated
      hues was to have been torn from my person by my brothers to show to my old
      man as evidence of a lie they were going to tell him. And not knowing what
      turn of mind the now deliriously happy director would take next, I beat it&#8212;went
      outside and thought I would see the show through the green shutters which
      covered the old school house windows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Outside, I found that other deserters had preceded me.
      Bill McVay, a grown young man, bewhiskered for the occasion, with a
      flowing white beard the likes of which has seldom been seen on this earth
      since the days of Moses, said, in his drawling voice, &#8220;I could drink
      all the whisky the old town&#8217;s got and it wouldn&#8217;t faze me&#8212;but
      that thing has bumped me off my feet. She&#8217;ll have to get someone
      else to take my part.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Actually, I was afraid to remain in the cast, fearing,
      the way things were happening, fast and furious like, that I might be
      persuaded against my will to appear before that hilariously responsive
      audience with greatly reduced apparel. I really was in a dangerous spot.
      The plot called for partial forced disrobement. Knowing the hyenas who
      posed as my brothers, and knowing also that those brothers had caught the
      spirit of the producer in a large way, I had the feeling that when they
      would have finished with me, working in that free atmosphere, that it
      would have been sans pants for little Johnny.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It should be borne in mind that the director of this
      very extraordinary show was an extremely odd woman, very religious, and
      sincere&#8212;and, having ideas of her own, she had the courage to mirror
      them bounteously in her work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The show was all right, of course. Biblical, and all
      that. And, viewed with an eye for the beautiful, it was all that Van said
      it was. But coming as it did in an age of many clothes for women, it was a
      revelation.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The discussion of odd characters was going strong when
      I entered the corner grocery store one evening. I did not join in the
      discussion for the simple reason that the range of observations did not go
      far enough back to take in the really odd ones&#8212;as I knew them. Had I
      told what I&#8217;m going to tell now, without supporting evidence it
      would, perhaps, have branded me as a prevaricator, and I wouldn&#8217;t
      have liked that. But I&#8217;m taking no chances now. Supporting evidence
      is at hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Speaking of odd characters, Wetmore had &#8216;em in the
      old days&#8212;in numbers. In truth, this assertion takes in just about
      everyone, except of course Thee and Me&#8212;that is, if Thee are still
      living. The odd characters dominating this story were Mr.</span> <span>O.</span>
      <span class="c2 c0"> Bates, Mr. Peter Shuemaker, and Mr. Jim Riley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But first, an opening paragraph introducing a fourth
      character that shall be nameless&#8212;that is, in spelled out letters. I
      think I shall call my man Mr. June, and guarantee that I have not missed
      his real name more than thirty days. Also, he had a brother in the
      business, and the firm-name was June Bros.&#8212;only this is one month
      away from it, in the springtime.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. June came into my printing office to arrange for
      some advertising&#8212;and also to get a load of fire insurance. I wrote
      fire insurance on the side. He was bringing a stock of clothing from his
      store in Atchison, and putting it in the Bates grocery store below the
      printing office, in the Bleisener block.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. June inquired of me about our fire fighting
      facilities, and as to whether or not we had waterworks. When I told him we
      had no waterworks and practically no fire protection, he almost let his
      portly Jewish self fall off the chair. He promised, &#8220;The first thing
      you should have waterworks when I come.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I told Mr. June that he was moving in with a man who had
      the agency for a sure-shot fire fighting hand grenade. This seemed to hit
      him a little off guard&#8212;but he rallied, and said he would
      investigate. It is presumed that his investigation was satisfactory. He
      moved in right away. Also, he might have heard about Mr.</span> <span>O.</span>
      <span class="c2 c0"> Bates&#8217; ineffective demonstration with his hand
      grenades. They had &#8220;fizzled&#8221; on him a while back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The clothing stock had been in the building only about
      sixty days when a mysterious fire occurred at 11:45, in the night&#8212;old
      time. It started in the oil room under the stairs leading up to my office.
      I was working late that night, with a shaded coal oil lamp on my desk.
      When I looked away from my work, I was startled by a solid wall of smoke
      which had come up through a stovepipe hole in the rear end of the room and
      stood only a few feet away from my desk. Alex Hamel had been working with
      me, but he had left the office some time before that. Also, Myrtle Mercer
      had been working that night, and I had gone out to take her home&#8212;leaving
      the office in total darkness while I was away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Alex Hamel and Bill McAlester, a barber, were first to
      show up after I had rushed out and yelled &#8220;Fire!&#8221; It was not
      long before a crowd had assembled. Some gave their attention to the fire
      in the building, while others rushed up stairs to my office, against my
      protest. There was no fire in the printing office. &#8220;Chuck&#8221;
      Cawood dashed a bucket of water on my shaded coal-oil lamp, and rushed out
      of the room, yelling, &#8220;I put it out&#8212;I&#8217;ve put it out!&#8221;
      Chuck&#8217;s water had also ruined an order of printed stationery ready
      for delivery. Others milled about in the dark and &#8220;pied&#8221;
      several galleys of type we had set for the paper which was to come out the
      next day. The clothing stock was carried to the street&#8212;and the fire
      was put out before it had done much damage. Since there were two occupants
      of the store room, no one could say with certainty whose fire it might
      have been.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Jew&#8217;s insurance was canceled in due course. He
      said, &#8220;If I don&#8217;t got insurance, I&#8217;ll not stay in a town
      which don&#8217;t got waterworks.&#8221; I reminded him that he still had
      Mr. O. Bates, with his hand grenades. It was but a short while before this
      that Mr.</span> <span>O.</span> <span class="c2 c0"> Bates had acquired
      the agency for his hand grenades. He planned a demonstration in the public
      square, by making a pyramid of wooden boxes, about ten feet high, early in
      the afternoon as a sort of advertisement for the event to take place after
      dark. This advertising stunt brought him humiliating repercussions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The square was filled with people. Mr.</span> <span>O.</span>
      <span class="c2 c0"> Bates, a gabby auctioneer who really knew how to make
      a spiel, gave them a good one. He said, &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen. I
      have here the greatest fire extinguisher ever devised! But you don&#8217;t
      have to take my word for this! You shall see with your own eyes! Why, my
      friends, I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate one moment about building my bonfire
      right up against my own home.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then he backed off a few paces from the burning boxes and
      threw a grenade at the fire&#8212;but it failed to connect with the solid
      bumpboard, which had been placed in the center to break the glass bottles,
      and passed through the mass as a dud. He then tried again, hitting the
      bumpboard, but instead of quenching the fire, it made a decided spurt
      upwards. Then, with a huge grunt, Bates, threw them in as fast as he
      could, resulting in further spurts of blaze upward</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">up, up, and up!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It was then boos for Mr.</span> <span>O.</span> <span
      class="c2 c0"> Bates. He was a sadly confused man, numb with bewilderment.
      He stammered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fetch a man here who&#8217;ll show you
      that they will do the trick.&#8221; At a lesser publicized exhibition,
      Bates&#8212;and his man&#8212;had extinguished the fire quickly. Rumor had
      it that &#8220;Frosty&#8221; and &#8220;Cooney&#8221; had emptied the
      chemicals out of his grenades, and had filled them with coal oil.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr.</span> <span>O.</span> <span class="c2 c0"> Bates had
      unbounded faith in his grenades. He actually wanted to build his bonfire
      almost smack-up against the frame hotel building on the corner where Harry
      Cawood&#8217;s store is now. But &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter Shuemaker
      wouldn&#8217;t stand for that. &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter was a wiry little
      man of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry&#8212;much set in his ways, with a
      quick tongue with which to defend himself. He was always on the defense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Frosty&#8221; Shuemaker had said, with reason,
      &#8220;Granddad, don&#8217;t you let that old windjammer light his fire
      near the hotel. You don&#8217;t know what might happen,&#8221; and &#8220;Uncle&#8221;
      Peter had snapped, &#8220;Goway, Forrest&#8212;who&#8217;s asking you for
      advice?&#8221; But, I think, &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter had &#8220;smelled
      a mouse.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mr.</span> <span>O.</span> <span class="c0"> Bates</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">pompous, windy, and positive</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">told &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter
      that the proposed demonstration would do his hotel no more harm than for
      him to allow Jim Riley to ride his horse in and out of the hotel office&#8212;an
      occurrence that still rankled. &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter flew off the
      handle, so to speak, and spluttered, &#8220;It&#8217;s no-sicha-na-thing!
      I never permitted that lousy drunken pie-stealing galoot to ride into my
      hotel! And just who would pay me for my hotel if it should burn down?
      By-GODDIES, you couldn&#8217;t do it&#8212;Mr. Bates!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Since I have quoted Peter Shuemaker detrimental to the
      character of one Jim Riley, I shall now explain. Never like to leave any
      of the old fellows out on a limb. Then, too, there is still another reason
      for this elaboration. It is to keep the record straight. Some, I now
      learn, are inclined to question if I have quoted &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter
      verbatim. That I have you may be sure. I make no inventions. You can
      always bank on that. Why, I ask, should I want to feed you figments of
      fiction, when memory is stocked with so much of the real thing&#8212;spoken
      words by the old fellows, a thousand times better than anything an
      antiquated mind could conjure up now? And then there is always the little
      matter of accuracy to be considered. &#8220;No-sicha-na-thing&#8221; and
      &#8220;by-goddies&#8221; were his exact utterances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Not to be confused with the Soldier creek Jim Reilly,
      who built a house in town on the site where E. W. Thornburrow&#8217;s home
      is now, this Irishman owned land up in the Capioma neighborhood&#8212;a
      half section north of the Patrick Hand land. Jim Riley was a substantial
      farmer and cattleman. He was not married. Jim bached on the farm&#8212;but
      spent much of his spare time in Wetmore, always pretty close to the dram
      shops. He was a periodical hard drinker. And a prankster of the first
      order.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But as time went on&#8212;and as he prospered&#8212;Jim
      decided that he could change the baching situation for the better if his
      sister, whom he had left in Ireland years before, were here to keep house
      for him. He made the trip back to Ireland, but when he got there he
      learned that his sister was married and lived in California. He then made
      a hurried trip to the west coast&#8212;and in due time the sister, with
      her husband and several little Ketchums, became members of the Jim Riley
      household on the farm here. And through the hand of Fate title to the
      Riley lands later passed to the Ketchums.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As Bates had said, Jim Riley did ride his horse into
      Shuemaker&#8217;s hotel. And as &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter had spluttered,
      Jim did swipe his pies&#8212;baked for a big dance supper. Riley carted
      them out on the street in a wheelbarrow, and passed them out to anyone who
      would take them. But he paid. Jim always paid. His reputation for doing
      that was well established. Like the time when someone went into Rising&#8217;s
      general store and said Jim Riley was out in front smashing up a
      consignment of crockery that had just been unloaded on the high front
      porch, giving a war-whoop every time as the crocks he was throwing crashed
      in the street, Don Rising said, &#8220;Let him have his fun. He&#8217;ll
      pay.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, Jim Riley did deliberately back his wagon up to
      the post supporting Shuemaker&#8217;s prized birdhouse, hurriedly threw a
      logchain around the post&#8212;and drove off, giving one of his famous
      war-whoops. &#8220;Jim&#8217;s on another bender,&#8221; the oldtimers
      said&#8212;but I knew he was just plain drunk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Jim Riley dearly loved to torment Peter Shuemaker. And he
      liked to play hide-and-seek with the town marshal. But most of all, Jim
      loved his drink. And it was while burdened with a mixture of the two that
      he met his death</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">in 1887.
      While making a hurried getaway from the marshal his team of mules, under
      lash, turned a street corner too quickly, threw Jim out his spring-wagon&#8212;and
      broke his neck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And that bird-house&#8212;it was a three-decker, about
      a yard square, with entrances on all four sides, perched on top of a
      10-foot post out in front of the hotel. Here the martins of that day
      nested and multiplied in such numbers as to greatly overcrowd their living
      quarters. In the late summer months the new broods would have to take to
      the roof.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jim&#8217;s log chain, applied at the height of the
      nesting season, broke up all too many bird-nests to suit &#8220;Uncle&#8221;
      Peter&#8212;and it just about caused his to lose his religion. &#8220;Uncle&#8221;
      Peter took his newly-found religion seriously enough, but when suddenly
      angered he was a mite forgetful. Lapsing back into pre-conversion times,
      his overworked byword&#8212;by-goddies&#8212;was shortened up a bit, and
      with it went a blast of other sulphurous words telling the world what he
      meant to do to that scoundrel when and if he could ever lay hands on him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Peter Shuemaker was practically the sole support of
      the Baptist Church here for a time, in the old days. The Church membership
      was poor, and there came a lean time when the members wanted to close up
      shop&#8212;but &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter said no, &#8220;By-goddies,&#8221;
      he&#8217;d pay the preacher himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Having lost his wife, Shuemaker, in his late eighties,
      and always a bit on the contrary side, was now, with descendents in his
      home, a little hard to get along with. But he hit it off fine with his
      preacher. Then, one Sunday morning, when a beautiful camaraderie between
      preacher and parishioner was running high, the Reverend announced
      something special, a surprise, for the evening services. That surprise
      proved to be &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter going shakily down the aisle,
      altarward, with a feeble old woman, an octogenarian from God only knew
      where, clinging to his arm. She was an &#8220;importation.&#8221; Thus,
      one perceives, that in casting his bread upon the waters it had indeed
      been returned to &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter manifold. And for his
      descendents, who were keeping a watchful eye on his modest savings, it was
      as a devastating bombshell topping a most disturbing surprise. Son-in-law
      Don Rising &#8220;swore&#8221; the old gentleman had been &#8220;sold down
      the river.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The marriage did not endure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But, at that, &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter fared better,
      spiritually, &#8220;than did the preacher who showed him the way. The
      Reverend George Graham, evangelist, had pitched his gospel tent on the
      triangular spot of vacant ground across the street east of the Catholic
      Church in Wetmore back in the middle 80&#8217;s. With him was a buxom
      woman, with rosy cheeks</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">who
      sang quite well. And what with her good singing and George&#8217;s
      impassioned pleas for repentance they garnered a good harvest&#8212;very
      good, indeed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Reverend Graham invoked, with the wrath of Jehovah of
      old, all the terrors of hell upon unbelievers. Together, they slew the
      sinners. Even some quite good people were swayed into the belief that they
      ought to make amends and strive to measure up to the high plane of this
      super exhorter&#8212;and thus make sure of following through to the Great
      Beyond. There were among them converts with Methodist leanings, and
      converts with Baptist leanings</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">even
      one young lady was possessed of the gift of tongues. When it was all over
      here, the converts went their several ways, as the preacher had advised&#8212;or
      rather they began to map a course by which they might make the takeoff for
      the long journey. Then, with the second stand away from here</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">somewhere down around Lawrence</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">the preacher and the lady were publicly exposed for
      unholy conduct.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And yea, verily, the Reverend had a family somewhere
      abroad in the land.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Repercussions hit hard back here. The one great wrong
      done our converts was, as you might expect, heaped upon them by the
      unbelievers who had been consigned to the everlasting fire of brimstone by
      the now fallen preacher. As is usual with emotionally recruited converts
      there was some immediate backsliding, or cooling off, but when &#8220;twitted&#8221;&#8212;that&#8217;s
      what they called it then&#8212;by the ungodly, the stampede back to normal
      got under way and was, in the days that followed, made complete&#8212;save
      one. &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter was seemingly the only one of the many who
      could bring himself to believe that religion was religion&#8212;something
      pure, and worth keeping, even though it had been delivered to him through
      the channels of a dirty carrier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There is an old saying that &#8220;one should give the
      devil his due.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure that, regardless, the magnetic George
      did a power of good in his revivals here. While, it is true, his converts
      did not choose to &#8220;join-up&#8221; after the crash, until the
      backwash of that scandal had become tempered by time, they did, however,
      accept the opportunity to come into the fold under another standard
      bearer. And, unfortunately for the Baptists, the Methodists were first to
      hold a revival&#8212;and reap the harvest. And the girl who was &#8220;called&#8221;
      upon to babble in tongues, gave up the pursuit when it was evident that
      she was fooling no one but herself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At the time of the exposure, I was temporarily working
      for Bill Granger on his Centralia Journal, and boarding at the old
      McCubbin House, down by the tracks. Ed Murray</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">later, Mo. Pacific agent in Wetmore for many years&#8212;was
      clerk at the hotel. Professor Roberts, principal of the Centralia Public
      Schools, was the third person present when the Evening Daily newspaper was
      brought in. After reading the exposure article, I passed the paper to Mr.
      Roberts, with comment that I had attended Graham&#8217;s revival meetings
      in Wetmore. Mr. Murray had his say about preachers in general, and about
      one Reverend Locke in particular&#8212;of the latter, quite complimentary,
      however.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">As he read, Mr. Roberts said, &#8220;Say&#8212;you, a
      newspaperman&#8212;here&#8217;s something you ought to commit, for future
      use.&#8221; For future use? He meant, let us hope, only as a model for
      phrase building to be used on occasion. That Mr. Roberts, he was a mighty
      clever young man&#8212;quite young, then. It was a long time ago,
      sixty-one years to be exact</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      I still remember.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The newspaper report was vague as to the exact nature
      of the preacher&#8217;s misstep, and I shall not attempt to state it here
      lest I might do someone an injustice. So, then, let&#8217;s let George do
      it. The paper quoted him, thus:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;I have the consolation, small though it be, of
      knowing that though my bark goes down amid the turbid waters of Illicit
      love the shores of Time are marked with many such wrecks.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Prettily phrased. But no further comment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">NOTE</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">This

      Cassity, (80), grandson. And they go further, saying: The $1,000 he paid
      to rid himself of the woman, plus what it had cost him to get her
      (preacher&#8217;s reward) just about cleaned &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter.

      double, as always&#8212;and liked it.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if I could say here
      that Cassity was one of those converts? I&#8217;d say it, anyway&#8212;if

      <span class="c2 c0">After mulling the old thing over, I know now that the
      boy who sat with me in the reserved section at Evangelist George Graham&#8217;s
      meetings, as intimated in the foregoing article, was not Peter Cassity. It
      was his brother Bill. Pete tells me that he was farming at the time over
      on Wolfley creek and did not attend the meetings regular&#8212;but don&#8217;t
      ever think Pete did not remember his raising, when he did get in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Bill Cassity had the nerve and the Biblical knowledge to
      stand up in a big way for his Maker. That boy had an almost irresistible
      line, and it was, at times, questionable whether the minister, or the
      converts&#8212;with Bill well out in the lead</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">were doing most in the matter of gathering in the
      prospects.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When my uncle, the Rev. Thomas S. Cullom, minister of
      a Methodist Church in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife Irene, and two
      daughters, Lora and Clevie, paid a visit to their Wetmore relatives in
      1908, the Reverend told me that in his Church, and throughout the south,
      it was customary during revivals to have &#8220;exhorters&#8221; stationed
      in the congregation to give supplementary support to the minister&#8217;s
      pleas for the redemption of lukewarm and tottering souls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I asked him if his exhorters ever broke in on his
      impassioned pleas in a discordant manner&#8212;that is, a little off key?
      &#8220;Cert&#8217;nly,&#8221; he said, with fine southern accent. &#8220;My
      exhorters are very devout workers for the Lord, and sometimes when filled
      to overflowing with the Holy Ghost, they say their lines and then keep
      right on exhorting and sometimes steal the whole show.&#8221; This ungodly
      reference to his Church as a show was made with a wink and a grin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And so, with the old time revivals here, the minister&#8217;s
      exhorters, under another name of course, sometimes ran away with the show.
      This brings us back to Bill Cassity, first born of Newton and Anne
      Shuemaker-Cassity. Bill did just that on at least two occasions in the
      Evangelist&#8217;s revival here. He had the Christian training to do it
      courageously.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">While still a young man, Bill Cassity went to Colorado,
      worked in the mines and smelters, at high wages, and ordered the Spectator
      sent to him there</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      later to Los Angeles. Bill came home once, told me he liked his work in
      Colorado, or rather the big wages&#8212;but he did not like the characters
      he had to associate with. In California, still on the right side of the
      laws of God and man, Bill pushed his penchant for righteousness a little
      too far for his own good. As a detective, self-appointed or otherwise, he
      learned much of the ways of the Los Angeles underworld&#8212;and, it was
      said, the boys took him for a ride and failed to bring him back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And again, some twenty-odd years ago, Than Gustafson, a
      former Wetmore man, older brother of our Fred Gustafson</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and in a legal way Fred&#8217;s brother was also his
      brother-in-law, the two Gustafson boys having married sisters, Adelia and
      Ophelia, daughters of S. M. Hawkins&#8212;is supposed to have been taken
      for a one-way ride by the Rocky Mountain crooks. He left his home in
      Denver, a wife and two children, one evening in line of his duties</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and was never heard of again.
      Than Gustafson evidently knew too much for his own good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When in gangdom, it is wise to be dumb.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Under the old system, in revivals, the first converts
      either appointed themselves or were delegated to work among the
      congregation as boosters for the minister&#8212;something like Uncle Tom&#8217;s
      &#8220;exhorters.&#8221; They would go out in the audience, usually in
      pairs, and plead with you, cry, and sniffle over you&#8212;an actual fact&#8212;in
      a manner that would - make you feel mighty cheap. The boy who respected
      them, loved them through long associations, was struck dumb. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One particularly sanctified woman&#8212;no one could
      ever doubt her sincerity; I had known her for years, and she was always so&#8212;with
      redoubled sniffling tendencies as of the moment, accompanied by the
      prettiest girl that ever walked down a church aisle or any other avenue in
      Wetmore, a girl whom I had just about given up as lost to a certain rich
      man&#8217;s son, on account of her papa&#8217;s preference for the other
      boy, and because &#8220;papa&#8221; said I played poker, made a firm stand
      in front of me one night. I knew before the old girl began to sniffle
      that, on account of the young girl, I would, sooner or later, find myself
      in a front row. More than one boy went forward in that meeting because he
      did not have the heart to disappoint them&#8212;and maybe there was also
      the attraction of a girl. Girls were more susceptible to the worker&#8217;s
      pleas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The older woman talked rapidly, between sniffles, in
      terms only partly understood by me&#8212;but the girl&#8217;s radiant
      smile told me much. I would not permit them to march me up to the front,
      as other workers were doing with prospects, but I promised to sit with the
      young girl in the reserved corner on the following night&#8212;and see
      what would happen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I hope the good people will pardon me for mixing my
      worldly activities with the more decent church sittings</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">but this seems the opportune time for me to &#8216;fess
      up. In this story I mean to come clean&#8212;tell everything, and have as
      little of the old hero stuff in it as is consistent with the making of a
      good story.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I had been to church&#8212;Methodist protracted meeting</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and then dropped in on the boys
      in the DeForest store at the virtual close of a little poker game. Even
      now I hate to think what Henry DeForest would have done to us had he known
      his dry goods counter was serving as a poker table. One man, Willard
      Lynch, dropped out while the deal was in progress, and said I might play
      his hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">This was to be my first poker game. Also, it should have
      been my last&#8212;but it wasn&#8217;t. Not that it ever became an
      obsession with me. But, in general, it is not an elevating attainment&#8212;and
      it is something which any self-respecting young man can very well do
      without. It was, however, my last game in Mr. Henry&#8217;s store. I
      wanted to retain, at all costs, his respectful opinion of me. And the
      other boys finally saw the error of their ways</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and changed their meeting place. On the cleaner side,
      I will say that I never learned to shoot craps, never bet on elections,
      ball games, or the horses; never drank or caroused, wouldn&#8217;t feel
      &#8220;at &#8220;home&#8221; at the popular cocktail party; was never in
      court as complainant or defendant&#8212;and was only once in my whole life
      in court as a witness, at which time, had I told the Whole Truth as I was
      sworn to do, I could have been jailed for my ignorance. I was an untutored
      member of the Kansas Grain Dealers Association, which was under
      investigation. Also, I want to say in the outset that this poker stigma
      was not the thing which had lowered me in the opinion of &#8220;Papa.&#8221;
      It was the more powerful evil&#8212;money&#8212;of which I had none. But
      there was one bright spot in the clouded picture. The rich man&#8217;s son
      looked a lot better to &#8220;Papa&#8221; than he did to the girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, in this, my first poker game, I picked up four
      natural aces, and if you know only as much as I knew then, you would
      consider it a top hand. No one had told me they were playing the joker
      wild, &#8220;cut and slash.&#8221; I bet a nickel. Alfred Anderson called,
      and raised me a dime. Two of the other boys called Alfred&#8217;s
      fifteen-cent bet&#8212;and the dealer, Sidney Loop, (clerk in the store),
      dropped out of the play. I thought my four aces were good for ten cents
      more, and not possessing a loose dime, I dug up a five-dollar bill. Alfred
      was up on his toes, and said, &#8220;You aiming to bet all that?&#8221; I
      replied, &#8220;No&#8212;only aiming to call your dime raise.&#8221; Still
      upon his toes, a little higher now, he said rather anxiously, &#8220;If
      you want to bet it all, I&#8217;ll call it&#8212;you can&#8217;t bluff me.&#8221;
      I took one more look at my hand&#8212;and not one of the aces had gotten
      away. And then I said, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll just bet it all.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, if you know the game, you are maybe expecting to
      hear that he had a set of fives, including the joker of course. But it was
      not Alfred who held them. His four kings were not good. It was the dealer,
      the man who had dropped out because I had dropped in, who had five fives.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But this I did not know until two days later, not
      until after I had gone to church again and contributed $5.00 to Mrs.
      Draper&#8217;s fund for buying Christmas candies for her Sunday School
      kiddies. Alfred&#8217;s sister Phoeba, as personal representative of our
      dear old Sunday School Superintendent, took my contribution with gracious
      acknowledgment, as though it were not tainted money. And Mrs. Draper&#8212;the
      less chivalrous boys called her &#8220;Mother Corkscrew&#8221; because she
      wore her gray hair in ringlets at shoulder length&#8212;came to me on the
      double quick, shrieking her praise of me, and intimated that this generous
      gift might get me places.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Alfred said that inasmuch as he surmised he had been
      cold-decked out of the five&#8212;thankfully with no aspersion attachment&#8212;that
      I should have at least given the donation in both our names. But that
      would have been risky. Alfred was a rather white &#8220;black sheep&#8221;
      in a very religious family, and Sis would most likely have wanted to know
      how come? The fact that Sidney and Willard were keeping company with
      sisters at that time may have had nothing to do with the introduction of
      that cold deck. And then again it might have. Sidney said the fellow
      needed &#8220;taking down&#8221; a bit</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">and that it was planned to give the losers back their money.
      A fat chance they would have of getting their money back now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Until now I had only stood, by and watched a penny-ante
      game in the new opera house over the Morris store, where the clerks</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">Dave Clements, Bill McKibbon, George
      and Chuck Cawood, Bob Graham&#8212;and some younger fry, congregated on
      Sundays. And then, too, as a kid, I had been present on several occasions
      at a somewhat bigger game in the Neville residence on this same corner.
      But here I did not have a chance to closely observe the technique of the
      game&#8212;for I was under the table most of the time. The men played
      altogether then with &#8220;shinplaster&#8221; money</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">undersized ten, twenty-five, and fifty cent pieces of U.
      S. paper currency, and the breeze caused from shuffling the cards would
      sometimes blow the money off the table. Mr. Jim Neville said I might keep
      all I could get my hands on</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      I think it was a sort of house rule that the players were not to contend
      roughly with me for the fluttering pieces. Still I think I got more kicks
      than the law allowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, I once saw the women playing poker in this same
      home&#8212;and they were using &#8220;shinplaster&#8221; too&#8212;but
      they were not generous enough to invite me to go down under. I do not wish
      to name them. Nor would I have mentioned the boys&#8217; names but for the
      fact all of them have now gone to their reward. And, besides, despite the
      undercurrent that it was not considered strictly genteel, everybody, more
      or less, played poker then&#8212;even, it was said, Father Bagley, our
      first High Priest, would take a hand occasionally. There was a regular
      fellow. For him it was Mass of a Sunday morning, then base ball or
      horse-racing in the afternoon, without fail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With this slow and awkward beginning it was a long,
      long time before I got nerve enough to sit in a private poker game as
      guest of a friend, in Kansas City, with a player who afterwards became
      President of the United States. He did not impress me as likely timber
      then. But, may I say, that when once in the running, he showed &#8216;em
      that he was truly from Missouri&#8212;and that, surprisingly, he could, in
      a pinch, run like a scared rabbit. Politics was his forte.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In explanation of the Girl-Papa-Richboy incident: I had
      sent a boy with a note asking the girl for her company for a dance, a
      private dance to be given by our select crowd, of which she was a
      favorite. The boy came back without a written reply&#8212;but he said she
      told him to tell me that she would go with me. This being rather unusual,
      I asked the -boy if that was all she said? &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said,
      &#8220;her mother said, &#8216;Now, girlie, you know what your father will
      say&#8217;</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and the girl
      said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;m going with him anyway&#8217;.&#8221;
      I had not known about the rich man&#8217;s son trying to edge in, and this
      indicated slap by her papa was a grievous blow to my ego.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I sent the girl another note, telling her in simple words&#8212;I
      always made &#8216;em simple now since having once, to no avail, slopped
      over ridiculously</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">that I
      had wormed out of the boy the remarks between mother and daughter, and
      that in consequence thereof I deemed it wise for me to cancel the date,
      until I could find out what it was all about. I may say I never sent but
      one formally phrased note to a girl in all my life&#8212;and that got me
      exactly nothing. That literary boy, Ecky Hamel, dictated it for me, and to
      make matters worse, it was to his girl. And he really wanted it to click&#8212;to
      ward off, in his absence, some dangerous competition.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">However, I once got a neatly written acceptance to an
      ultra-formal and gorgeously phrased note bearing my name, which I didn&#8217;t
      write. I was a new boy in Seneca at the time. I met a lot of girls at the
      skating rink in the old Armory building on upper Main Street. Ena Burbery,
      pretty and agreeably alert, was good on roller skates. Ena and four other
      girls worked as trimmers in the millinery department of the Cohen store.
      Ena talked. And the girls, all but one, joined in mailing her a note
      bearing my forged signature requesting her company for a swank party three
      days hence. Ella Murphy, one of the five, boarded and roomed at the
      Theodore Wolfley home, same as I did while working on Wolfley&#8217;s
      newspaper, The Tribune. Ella said the note was formal and softly silly,
      and so did Ena say it was awful</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but, she giggled, &#8220;I was not going to let that spoil a
      date, especially for a party like that.&#8221; Now, the ridiculous part of
      it all is, that it was an exclusive party to be given by Seneca&#8217;s
      upper crust, to which I had no invitation. But, even so, it gave me
      elevated status for a little while, in a limited way. We compromised on
      the rink. And the girls, whom I never did meet, sent me an apology,
      through Ella Murphy, for recklessly abusing my name&#8212;and getting the
      girl a date. Ena was the section foreman&#8217;s daughter, but that was no
      handicap. I myself married a section foreman&#8217;s daughter, picked her
      for a winner from a sizable field of promising prospects.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Naturally, I wanted to know more about the status of
      the rich man&#8217;s son&#8212;and I got it too, back at the gospel tent
      the next night. The girl said nothing at all about my poker-playing
      proclivities. She was too sensible to try to reform a boy. Her idea was to
      pick &#8216;em as suited her fancy&#8212;and trust to luck. Indeed, she
      said in rebuttal of her father&#8217;s expressed opinion of me, that if
      her mamma only could have kept her mouth shut everything would have been
      all right, and that I would have never known. &#8220;And besides,&#8221;
      she said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t drink, and papa does&#8212;a little; and
      you don&#8217;t smoke, and papa does, though he does not smoke cigarettes.&#8221;
      A cigarette smoker in those days was considered cheap. How times have
      changed. The girl had overlooked one of &#8220;Papa&#8217;s&#8221;
      weaknesses, but for me to have mentioned it to her then would have got me
      nothing that I was not now likely to get anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This exchange of ideas took place in the reserved
      corner of the arena in advance of the regular session while other
      congregated young people were likely thinking of an afar off haven having
      streets paved with jasper and gold. Something about streets and jasper and
      gold ran in the lines of the old song books. Also, I dare say, some of the
      converts might have cringed a little at the thought of an everlasting fire
      of brimstone&#8212;this idea emanating from George, the Evangelist&#8212;which
      the wayward and lukewarm alike might, if they didn&#8217;t watch out, fall
      into in a last-minute rush for that afar off haven.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Every evening during his meetings Reverend Graham
      would institute a two-minute session of silent prayer. In - view of George&#8217;s
      admitted downfall at a later stand, I trust it will not now be considered
      sacrilegious for me to hazard an opinion that those silent periods offered
      the preacher an excellent opportunity to pray for grace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was not required by custom then for those seeking
      salvation to come clear down to earth, and some merely bowed their heads,
      rested them on the backs of deserted chairs, and whispered when so
      inclined. The girl and I, we did not desecrate the hallowed moment. We
      didn&#8217;t have to. Silence was golden. I was conceited enough just then
      to believe that this beautiful girl, thoroughly repentant or no, would
      have gone through George&#8217;s pictured purgatory for me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And nothing happened that could be chalked up as
      material gain for the better life. Well, I ask you, how in the name of
      high heaven, could it? I&#8217;m not particularly proud of it, though.
      But, you know, if your chariot does not come along, you can&#8217;t take a
      ride. I certainly do not wish to cast reflection on the Church. The
      Church, as a Church, is really a grand institution. I should hate to think
      where we would be in a world without it. Henry DeForest, Yale graduate,
      said the tent doings was proselytizing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Perhaps you would like to know how I fared in the days
      to come with this renewed lease on life which the Evangelist&#8217;s
      revival had brought me? Well, &#8220;Papa&#8221; shelved his dislike of my
      poker-playing, and both he and &#8220;mama&#8221; greeted me as a friend
      ever after. They were really fine people&#8212;I might say the very BEST,
      with capitals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Papa&#8221; had played a little poker himself&#8212;and
      that too, by-gosh, in our penny-ante game&#8212;and his wish for a switch
      in the matter of his daughter&#8217;s company was based on too slim
      premise to set store by, now that the girl had told him with flat-footed
      finality that it would not work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And the girl? Well, I had to go away, first to
      Centralia, then to Seneca to help Theodore Wolfley print his newly
      purchased Tribune, and I turned her over to my best poker-playing friend
      to keep for me against the time when I might return.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, to do me this small favor my friend had to drop
      another girl with whom he had been keeping company steadily for two years.
      He probably saw possibilities in the change, but he was really too fine&#8212;and
      too ably assisted by the girl&#8212;to take advantage of a friend&#8217;s
      absence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As my trusted friend and my girl in escrow were
      already lined up for the party that first night after my return, it was
      mutually agreed that&#8212;just for once&#8212;I should line up with my
      friend&#8217;s discarded girl, who was still free. It worked out all right&#8212;and
      it was wonderful to be back with the old crowd again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, don&#8217;t jump at conclusions. Though she was a
      mighty fine girl, and good looking too, I did not find her preferable to
      the other girl. Just why I made it a regular habit for nearly a year, was
      quite a different matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We all belonged to an exclusive clique known as The
      Silver Stockings. Why so named I never learned. One unalterable
      requirement for the men was that each had to bring a girl&#8212;or a wife.
      No &#8220;stags&#8221; were permitted at our parties. This was because a
      certain unwanted young man had the disturbing habit of sneaking in at
      public gatherings and monopolizing our girls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The thoughtful young man of that period did not think
      of marriage the first time he went out with a girl. In our community none
      but the rich man&#8217;s four sons were financially (in prospect) able to
      indulge in such dreams. And, besides, by this time I had had a change of
      heart&#8212;resolved to consider the future of the girl. After all &#8220;Papa&#8221;
      might have had the right idea. I figured that an attractive girl like she,
      would not be justified in playing along with me until I could make my
      stake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And again, were I to pursue my chances&#8212;which at
      this time were, I flattered myself, in a high bracket&#8212;who could say
      with certainty that &#8220;Papa&#8221; would not someday become afflicted
      with a recurrent attack of that silly notion the first time that the
      favored son, or maybe another of the RM&#8217;s sons might strut his stuff
      in the presence of the girl. Then, too, something fine&#8212;alas,
      something very fine, was now gone out of the picture that could never be
      returned. I reluctantly decided to let matters drift along as temporarily
      planned the first night back home&#8212;and see what would happen. It was
      my hardest decision.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had seen too many people trying to make a stake and
      raise a family at the same time. My father made more money than most&#8212;but
      with ten children, it was slavery for him. He worked sixteen hours a day
      at his trade as shoemaker&#8212;and even then he had to skimp, and work
      and skimp. But he took a philosophical view of matters, and on the whole
      his was a rather contented life. One time when he was complaining about
      the difficulty of getting ahead, I suggested that maybe he had erred in
      first taking on the responsibility of raising a big family.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He said, &#8220;Well, they kept coming and I couldn&#8217;t
      knock &#8216;em in the head.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;They didn&#8217;t start coming until
      after you were married&#8212;&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He yelped, as if something had stung him, &#8220;Of
      course not, you young upstart!&#8221; That was a time when he would have
      been justified in applying the kneestrap, his ever ready implement of
      correction, to my posterior. But my father was a forbearing man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;Gosh, Dad&#8212;I only meant to say if
      you had waited until after you had made your stake, you would not now be
      bothered with this burdensome load.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He said, quickly, &#8220;If I had waited longer where
      do you think you&#8217;d be now, young man?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, that was something to think about. It might have
      upset the whole continuity. I think we older boys reminded him too often
      of the excess baggage he was struggling along with&#8212;only, however,
      when he would begin his lamenting, usually about the high tariff.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I can think of nothing more disturbing than to be
      caught short-handed (otherwise broke) in a community marked by a dearth of
      opportunity to earn a living&#8212;-With dependents to care for. Such was
      our country in the early days. My parents had rubbed up against this
      situation on numerous occasions. However, unlike some of our neighbors,
      the time never came when we did not have enough to eat. But that &#8220;hand
      to mouth&#8221; rule of living could not rub out the anxiety.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was an era when the ambitious young fellow was of
      necessity compelled early in life to begin laying-by for the &#8220;rainy
      day&#8221; if he did not wish to run the risk of becoming an object of
      charity&#8212;and who did in the old days? It was then considered about
      the last straw. It took a long time to lay-by a competence in the old
      days. The average wage-earner gets as much per hour now as was paid for a
      whole day&#8217;s work then&#8212;when ten hours was a day. This is not to
      say the young &#8220;sprout&#8221; could not marry before he had a
      competence. He did&#8212;recklessly. And paid the price.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was to avoid such conditions as this that I made a
      firm resolve to defer marriage until I could make a stake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I set my goal at $10,000, and when things got going good
      I kept right on going until this goal was more than doubled</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and in subsequent years learned that it was none too
      much:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, in strict honesty, I think this cautious
      streak was inherited rather than instilled in me by observations. My
      father had entertained the same cautious notions. Orphaned early in life,
      he made his own way&#8212;saved, and had what he called a nice nest-egg at
      the age of 25. He went from Kentucky over into Tennessee to visit
      relatives, met my mother while there&#8212;and married her the next time
      he came into her back-woods community. And had it not been for the cruel
      Civil War&#8212;and the guerillas&#8212;I am pretty sure: that I would
      have had a rich Dad regardless of his super-abundance of kids.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, conditions changed for the better for father.
      When his boys got big enough to lessen the burden, and then in time lift
      it altogether, he had an easy life. My brother Frank worked with him in
      the shoeshop, and at the same time conducted a shoe store in the front end
      of the building, with our sister Nannie in charge. When Frank decided to
      go to California to join his brother Dave in business, he gave them the
      shoe stock. I had written insurance in the sum of $1,000 for Frank, and
      when the assigned policy was about to expire I mentioned the matter one
      day at the dinner table. Father said, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t need any
      insurance.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I renewed the policy anyway, paid the premium myself,
      and said no more about it. Then, some months later, a fire destroyed the
      old Logue frame store building across the street, in early evening&#8212;and
      the town was out in numbers. There was little chance of the blaze reaching
      my father&#8217;s shop, but he and several excited volunteers were making
      ready to remove the shoe stock to the street. I told him that he better
      just get his books and records where he could put his hands on them in
      case of need, and to leave the stock in the building for a while, at
      least. Thinking to ease his fears, I said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a
      thousand dollar insurance policy on the stock.&#8221; He exclaimed,
      excitedly, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s not enough!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">By this time&#8212;we are now back again on the matter of
      girls, mostly</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">the girl&#8217;s
      papa had been elevated to the Mayorality, and the family was now operating
      the Wetmore hotel. On one of my trips home from Seneca, after spending a
      pleasant hour with the girl, I dropped in on the poker game, just to greet
      the boys, and watch the play. I had reformed then</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">mostly, I think, on account of the girl. Incidentally,
      I may say I reformed more times than a backslider ever confessed his sins&#8212;every
      time, I think, on account of a girl&#8212;before finally realizing that it
      was not the way to build character.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The game then was in the Billy Buzan residence&#8212;af
      ter his wife&#8217;s death&#8212;on the corner where Bob Cress&#8217;
      residence is now, west of the telephone office. It was the original
      William Cawood location, with the west portion of the high fence
      (seven-foot up and down pine boards) still standing. That high fence had
      enclosed four lots, and held in captivity a &#8220;pet&#8221; deer for
      several years. When the Mayor and a guest of the hotel came in at the
      front door, I slipped out the back door, as I thought unobserved by His
      Honor, and streaked it, in bright moonlight, to the fence and went over
      almost without touching. The next day the Mayor said to me, &#8220;Young
      fellow, I saw your shirt-tail going over that high board fence last night.&#8221;
      But he hadn&#8217;t. It was before the young sports had begun to wear
      their shirt-tails on the outside of their pants. And then again I never
      was guilty of that slovenly habit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">About that deer. It finally jumped over the gate at the
      southeast corner of the enclosed grounds&#8212;and was gone for several
      days. But it came back and jumped in again. Then, it made a game of
      jumping out and jumping in</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">with
      periodic trips to the country. Then, one morning there were two deer in
      the enclosure. I think the &#8220;pet&#8221; deer tried its best to
      domesticate the visitor</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      after three days, the call of the wilds claimed them both.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Some years later&#8212;after he had spent a couple of
      years in Arkansas, and was now back in the hotel again, in Wetmore&#8212;&#8221;Papa&#8221;
      was in a tight spot at Enid, Oklahoma, the third day after the opening of
      the Cherokee Strip, September 16,1893. He had made the run, staked a
      claim, and was in line&#8212;a very long line&#8212;at the Land Office,
      waiting his turn to file. I had already filed on my claim. While in line,
      I observed soldiers, who were supposed to be on hand to see that everyone
      would get a fair deal, were running in people ahead of me&#8212;and a
      little later, a man I shall simply call Eddie&#8212;apparently in the role
      of chief grafter&#8212;whom I had known in Wetmore, approached me with a
      proposition to advance me in line for $5. I was too near the door to be
      interested&#8212;and besides, my brother Dave who held a filing number
      next to mine, promised to &#8220;wipe the earth up&#8221; with Ed if we
      should be delayed further. Might say here that the gang followed this
      remunerative activity with another dirty practice. They filed contests on
      claims, so that the rightful locators would, in many instances, buy them
      off rather than stand the expense of fighting the case. Then Dave had to
      give Mr. Ed that promised thrashing. It got Dave a prompt withdrawal of
      the contest. I was the only one of our party of four who did not have to
      fight a contest. My friendship, or co-operation with the crooks, whichever
      way you choose to look at it, had, I presume, saved me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After I had filed on my claim, I carried the &#8220;good&#8221;
      news of Mr. Eddie&#8217;s activities to &#8220;Papa.&#8221; I knew he was
      anxious to get back home to his hotel business, where he was trying hard
      to re-establish himself after returning from Arkansas. He asked me to
      contact Mr. Eddie for him&#8212;and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be your uncle.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The soldiers advanced him to near the door&#8212;and
      there the line became static once more, as other advancements were being
      pushed in ahead of him. Then Ed told me that for $10 more the soldiers
      would put him through the door without delay. &#8220;Papa&#8221; dug up
      the $10, and said, &#8220;Do this for me Son, and I&#8217;ll dance at your
      wedding.&#8221; Now he could call me &#8220;Son&#8221; and offer to dance
      at my wedding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There are three girls prominently featured in this
      story, whose names I do not wish to divulge. Substituting, I maybe should
      call the first one Miss Beautiful, for she was all that. But from here on,
      until further notice, I shall refer to them as My Best Girl, The Old Girl,
      and The Kid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In all too short time my nemesis, in the person of a
      certain rich man&#8217;s son, an older brother of that other boy, got on
      my trail. I do not think it was to avenge his disappointed brother, but it
      could have been that. He told the boys it was to prove that he was &#8220;man
      enough&#8221; to &#8220;bump&#8221; me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, just for once, it was not a bad guess. He would
      be working on fertile ground. I didn&#8217;t care too much for the Old
      Girl anyway. She was my senior by four or five years, and naturally she
      would welcome a good &#8220;catch.&#8221; It was understood between us
      that she was only filling a vacancy, and thereby providing a way to keep
      us in the Silver Stocking circle. The thing I didn&#8217;t like was to be
      &#8220;bumped&#8221; just for the fun of it, as viewed by the RM&#8217;s
      son.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Mike Norton, clerk in the DeForest store, saw the rich
      man&#8217;s son write a letter to the Old Girl, and he thought this would
      be the time when the RM&#8217;s son would try to make good his boast.
      Three days hence there was to be a picnic in a grove south of Netawaka,
      and the Silver Stocking boys and girls were lining up to go in a body.
      Mike and other members of the circle put in two hours looking for me. The
      boys, and the girls too, were all for me, in this instance</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">but not even the King&#8217;s Horses could have
      stopped that boy in his purpose. The postmaster showed me the letter with
      the OG&#8217;s name spelled out in bold relief&#8212;and I was off at
      once, thinking I would now show this RM&#8217;s son that he could not do
      this to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Old Girl said she was awfully sorry&#8212;that she
      had promised another, naming the rich man&#8217;s son. I said, in
      substance&#8212;though really not sore at the OG, I think I was not in a
      frame of mind to phrase it just so&#8212;&#8221;Let&#8217;s see where we
      stand. The way things are shaped up now, I&#8217;m out&#8212;that is,
      barred from the Silver Stocking crowd by the rules of my own helpful
      making.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">She suggested that I go back to the girl I have
      designated as My Best Girl&#8212;said, &#8220;I KNOW you can, if you will
      just spunk up a little.&#8221; I had never &#8220;spunked&#8221; much with
      the OG.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;But,&#8221; I said, &#8220;if I should succeed
      in dating her, someone else would be out, and that someone is your old
      beau. Likely timber maybe. Then, in case your date does not choose to
      repeat, you might still have a chance to get back with the old crowd.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">She laughed</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">the OG was feeling pretty good, just then&#8212;and said,
      &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of it that way.&#8221; Now she giggled,
      &#8220;But, you know, I could always be a hanger-on, maybe even go with
      you and your girl&#8212;just in case.&#8221; A boy was permitted to take
      more than one girl&#8212;even a flock of them if he were unlucky enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Now the atmosphere around the OG&#8217;s home had
      changed, with exultant spirits taking a nose-dive. That letter was for the
      purpose of calling off a date. She was really too nice a girl to be buffed
      around like that</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but
      please note that I did not hold with any such buffings. She had forfeited
      her chance to go with the crowd to the picnic. Now, more than ever, she
      wanted to go. She first took her troubles to her bosom friend, Bessie
      Campfield, wife of Judge Elwin Campfield. She wanted to know how could
      she, with propriety, get word to me that after all she would be free to go
      with me to the picnic. Bessie had spent some anxious moments trying to
      round up a courier to apprise me of that letter. She said to the OG,
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that now. I could have told you about that
      fellow&#8217;s egotistical designs.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Old Girl lived with her aged parents, and when
      they would go away for the night, as they often did to visit another
      daughter in the country, she would have a young neighbor girl&#8212;not
      too young, but much younger than she-stay the night with her. The old
      folks were away now, and the young girl had been called in for the night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Old Girl was still worried. I&#8217;m now almost
      sorry that I ever started this &#8220;Old Girl&#8221; differential, as it
      smacks of disrespect</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and I
      do not want the reader to form any such ideas. The OG first asked the
      young girl to come up town with her&#8212;then, remembering that her best
      friend had dropped a hint that the ground upon which she now stood was
      insecure, she decided that she was not constitutionally able to face me
      just then with her problem. She sent the young girl, alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the Kid&#8212;that&#8217;s what they called her
      when we went together to the picnic, and thereafter as a member of the
      Silver Stocking crowd&#8212;said, &#8220;If you go with her now, you will
      be the biggest fool in the world. All she wants to go with you for, is to
      see who he takes,&#8221; naming the RM&#8217;s son.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Kid was smart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But please do not think the so-called Kid was betraying a
      trust. She was really a woman now. And, besides, she had reason to believe
      that, to use a homely expression, she were very soon</span> <span>going</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">to get the OG&#8217;s goat, anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And moreover, the Old Girl later told the &#8220;Kid,&#8221;
      perhaps in a gesture of discouragement, that I had gone with her steadily
      for nearly a year, and had never tried to kiss her. Had that not been the
      truth it would have been libel. -In the old days, the prudent young man
      did not dare kiss an old girl who was only filling a vacancy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Prior to this, the &#8220;Kid&#8221; and I had &#8220;starred&#8221;
      in a local entertainment entitled &#8220;Beauty and Beelzebub&#8221;</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">and mutual admiration had blossomed
      then. She was the Angel and I was the Devil. In the tableau, the Devil,
      encased in a tight-fitting black sateen cover-all, with horns and a
      four-foot forked tail, was suspended on wires about four feet off the
      floor when the curtain went up. Then the Angel, up in the clouds, began
      the descent with song, the singing increasing in volume as she came down
      bare feet first, with outstretched wings, settling in front of the Devil.
      The &#8220;Kid&#8221; made a pretty picture, with her abundant dark hair</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">which, I happen to know, came down
      nearly to her ankles</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">spread
      over the white flowing covering whose traditional folds parted in front
      just enough to indicate that she dwelt in a place where shoes and
      stockings were taboo. The Angel departed by the same route&#8212;wire and
      windlass mechanism&#8212;went up into the clouds from whence she had come,
      with more singing, at first in full voice, then fading, fading, fading
      away in a manner denoting distance. In her young budding womanhood the
      &#8220;Kid&#8221; made a beautiful Angel</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">and the clear, sweet singing was out of this world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Coral Hutchison was at first considered for the Angel.
      She was a beautiful girl, and a beautiful singer&#8212;and while she had a
      wonderful head of hair, quite as long as the &#8220;Kid&#8217;s,&#8221;
      its rather too blonde shade ruled her out. So the &#8220;Kid,&#8221; with
      the requisite dark hair, was given a place in the spot-light&#8212;and
      Coral did the singing behind the scenes.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sorry, I can&#8217;t tell you what event or setting
      that tableau portrayed. There was much more to the show, speaking parts
      and superb acting. And though clearly the &#8220;Kid&#8221; and I were
      &#8220;it,&#8221; the whole show was titled &#8220;Beauty and Beelzebub.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the picnic, my adversary, the rich man&#8217;s son,
      said to me, &#8220;I see you&#8217;ve got a new girl. How come?&#8221; I
      said, &#8220;Yeah&#8212;likewise you. Thanks for the assist.&#8221; After
      I had started to walk on, he called, &#8220;Hey, John, whatsha mean by
      that?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He was with Lou Kern. Hattie and Lou Kern, and Nina
      and Emma Bolman, were four Netawaka girls that were popular with our
      Silver Stocking crowd; as were also Caroline Emery, living in the country
      northeast of Wetmore, and her visiting friend, Mamie Blakeslee, a former
      neighbor whose home was now in Savannah, Mo.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mamie Blakeslee was a strikingly pretty girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I shall now dwell a bit on a personal incident in
      connection with this beautiful girl. It was away back in 1884. I don&#8217;t
      think the girl was on my mind that day when I went to St. Joe. But, in St.
      Joe, I ran onto Bill (Hickorynut) Bradley who was on his way to Savannah,
      and he asked me to go along with him. One Oliver Bateman was to be hanged
      for the murder of two little girls who had caught him in an embarrassing
      act. The railroad was offering excursion rates, and the sleepy old
      Missouri town was decked out in celebration colors, with refreshment
      stands all along the lane from the jail to the gallows in an amphitheater
      in the nearby woods&#8212;everybody on the make.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Unlike Hickorynut, the hanging did not interest me, but
      the thought of seeing Mamie did. I called at the Blakeslee home on the
      outskirts of Savannah</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">it
      was a farm traded by G. N. Paige for the Blakeslee farm near Wetmore&#8212;on
      the pretense of wanting to see Mamie&#8217;s brother Edwin, who had been
      my schoolmate in Wetmore. He was not at home. I remained a reasonable time
      with Mamie, aiming to work up a little courage, and maybe ask her to go
      places with me&#8212;but lost my nerve.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Two hours later I met Mamie, with another girl, on a
      downtown street near the St. Charles hotel. Mamie said there was to be
      skating at the rink that night, and would I like to go? I certainly would.
      So now, after all, we would be going places together.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I called at the Blakeslee home for the two girls, and the
      &#8216;skating was going fine. Then, of a sudden, Miss West told me that
      Mamie was in a jam. Her steady, a traveling salesman, had unexpectedly
      dropped in on her</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and, for
      some reason, likely well founded, Mamie had not intended to let him know
      about her going out with another fellow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I told Miss West that we could fix that all right, if
      she herself did not have a steady sticking around somewhere. Miss West
      laughed, and assured me she did not have a steady. &#8220;If agreeable,&#8221;
      I said, &#8220;you shall now be my company, and, to all appearances, Mamie
      shall be the hanger-on, free to desert me for her steady.&#8221; Miss West
      laughed again, though she looked as if she were a little concerned about
      my reference to Mamie as the new hanger-on. Well, it was a slip. It was a
      term often applied to the extra girls in our Silver Stocking circle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While visiting in Wetmore before this, Mamie had gone
      to a dance in Netawaka with a local man who proved to be not to her
      liking, and she had quit him cold at the dance hall door. Though it would
      hardly cause a ripple now, it was then considered about the worst thing
      that could happen to a young fellow&#8217;s social standing. I do not wish
      to identify him&#8212;yet I must give him a name to be used in Mamie&#8217;s
      pay-off to me for liberating her at the Savannah rink.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the substitution of names, one is liable to
      innocently hit upon somebody&#8217;s real name, and to avoid the
      possibility of making this error, I shall give him the surname of his
      business partner, and go through the customary formality of saying that
      any similarity in names is purely coincidental. The man was half-owner of
      the livery stable from which we all got our &#8220;rigs&#8221; that night.
      And, anyway, the partners left here together for the state of Washington
      many, many years ago, and there should be no chance for repercussions now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mamie knew that I was familiar with the Netawaka
      incident&#8212;in fact, it was I who did the shifting with Sidney Loop to
      get her back home. When Miss West had delivered my message, Mamie broke
      away from her steady, rolled gracefully around the hall, and plumped
      herself down by my side, saying, &#8220;Thank you so much! It gets me out
      of an awful jam! And I want you to know that this is no Dr. Fisher deal!&#8221;
      I wondered? You know a girl, in competition with other girls, might strive
      for long to vamp a certain good catch&#8212;which is always a girl&#8217;s
      privilege&#8212;and then when the chance offers, find herself tied up for
      the time being with someone that right away stinks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Blakeslee family formerly lived on a farm four
      miles northeast of Wetmore, directly north of the old Ham Lynn farm. Mamie&#8217;s
      father, Nelson Blakeslee, often called at my father&#8217;s shoeshop for a
      visit. One time they planned on chartering a car together and shipping to
      California. I did not know Mamie then&#8212;but have since wondered what
      might have happened had they gone through with their plans.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Evidently Mamie did not make the most of the opportunity
      afforded her that night back in Savannah. She married Frank Schilling, of
      Hiawatha. There were some dark surmises that she stole Caroline Emery&#8217;s
      beau. &#8220;Stole&#8221; is an ugly word to be written in connection with
      this sweet, conscientious girl&#8212;as I knew her then. I would rather
      believe that Miss Emery&#8217;s beau was a man of rare good judgment. I
      have not seen Mamie since that night at the skating rink in Savannah. Now
      widowed, she lives in Fairview</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">thirty minutes away from Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back again on the main theme: In the days which
      followed, I said to myself&#8212;thought it with vengeance, anyway&#8212;that
      I would like to see the color of the hair of any d&#8212;d RM&#8217;s son
      that could make me give up this one, meaning the &#8220;Kid,&#8221; of
      course. And may I say that for once I now believed I had my girl matters
      well in hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But, believe it or not, still another son of that same
      rich man tried his darndest to edge in. At this time the younger boys had
      the habit of lining up on the outside of the church, at Epworth League
      meetings, and grab themselves a girl, with a polite, and sometimes not so
      polite, &#8220;May I &#8220;see you home?&#8221; After the third &#8220;No,
      thank you,&#8221; from the &#8220;Kid,&#8221; the RM&#8217;s son told her
      to go to that place which is sometimes politely called hades.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mrs. Pheme Wood, a well meaning soul who had been an
      intimate friend of our family since the first day we came here in 1869,
      and who apparently took a special interest in my welfare, stopped me one
      day while passing her home, and said, &#8220;There&#8217;s something I
      want to ask you. Of course I don&#8217;t believe it, but I&#8217;ll ask
      anyway. Were you out sleigh-riding with Myrtle Mercer the day her father
      lay dead in the home?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle was the afore-mentioned &#8220;Kid.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had not intended to name her just yet, but her
      identity would have to come out soon anyway, as she figures in this story
      to the end. And then some.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said&#8212;but got no further.
      Pheme broke in, &#8220;It came to me pretty straight, and one would think&#8212;&#8221;
      I stopped her with a promise to &#8216;fess up, if she would not run to my
      mother with it. &#8220;Oh that,&#8221; she laughed, remembering a kindred
      incident, &#8220;was for your own good.&#8221; She had gone to my mother
      on an errand of mercy. That she had her wires badly crossed did not deter
      her. She said she had it on good authority that I was about to marry the
      aforesaid Old Girl, who was much too old for me; and that my mother ought
      to use her influence to prevent it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Myrtle&#8217;s father, John W. Mercer, section foreman,
      aged 39, had died suddenly of a heart attack while milking his cow one
      morning in February, 1888. And naturally, the family&#8212;the mother and
      five girls&#8212;had to make preparations for the funeral. Myrtle had a
      badly sprained ankle</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">acquired
      while ice-skating with George Peters on the creek near her home&#8212;but
      she managed to hobble up town, taking her baby sister Jessie with her. I
      followed them into the store, told Myrtle that I would get a sleigh from
      the livery stable and take them home. After driving the girls three blocks
      directly to their home, I picked up the Old Girl and we drove for an hour
      or more. I knew that Frank Fisher would charge me $2.00 anyway, and I
      wanted to get my money&#8217;s worth. I was seen picking up the &#8220;Kid&#8221;
      at the store and later seen driving with the Old Girl, and someone had
      imagined that the two girls were one and the same</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and that&#8217;s how the story got started.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When explained, Pheme could have no criticism of
      Myrtle, nor of me either for driving her home. But, being a woman of the
      old school, she was bound to have her say. She said, &#8220;It looks like
      you should have had more respect for Myrtle than to go joy-riding with
      that other girl at a time like that.&#8221; I was not sure that she didn&#8217;t
      have something there. I said, &#8220;Remember, not a word to my mother.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Ah, go on,&#8221; she laughed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I might say here, before passing this incident, that
      after the family had split up a few years later, Myrtle was sister and
      mother too, as well as guardian, for Jessie. And speaking of pretty girls,
      this attractive little one had the makings of a real beauty that in later
      years just about topped them all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The rich man&#8217;s sons were all fine boys&#8212;I
      think&#8212;but in view of their penchant for camping on my trail, the
      only compliment I wish to pay them now is to say: They did not play poker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My trusted friend did not marry the girl I loaned him.
      She went with her parents and three brothers to Arkansas</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and married down there. The trusted friend went to the
      Far West, made his stake, and married into a quite well-to-do family&#8212;and
      lived at Yakima, Washington.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Old Girl got her man too&#8212;an out-of-town man</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">after she had quit fooling around
      with the younger fry, and went with Davey Todd to Kansas City to live. She
      became a helpless invalid&#8212;and then, not having prepared himself in a
      financial way for such eventuality, Davey literally and figuratively had
      his hands full. But, to the best of his ability, he was good to her&#8212;carried
      her around as if she were a baby. How do I know? Well, the &#8220;Kid&#8217;s&#8221;
      sisters, -Jennie and Kathy, neighbors while here, helped him a lot in
      giving her needed attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now Euphema Wood speaks again. Commenting on this
      unfortunate affair, she said to me, &#8220;Now you can maybe appreciate
      all the grief I saved you.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Many years later, I met the mother of the girl whom I
      designated for this writing as My Best Girl, on the train out of Kansas
      City going to Atchison, her home at that time. I knew the girl had married
      a man whom the family were pleased to call a Southern aristocrat, living
      at Bald Knob, Arkansas. He was a merchant who carried the sharecroppers&#8212;mostly
      descendants of Ham&#8212;on his books until harvest time, virtually owning
      them. This gave him status in his home community, particularly with the
      colored folk</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and in
      traveling North this mark of distinction was greatly exaggerated. From
      what the girl told me, while on a visit back home, I think Mr. Walker was
      a worthy man&#8212;but that aristocracy appendage, I liked it even less
      than I liked the means that had been employed to push me out of the
      picture. It is a word that should never have been coined. I was pleased
      that the girl herself made no use of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the course of our talking over old times in
      Wetmore, the mother said, &#8220;I never could understand why those two
      did not marry,&#8221; meaning her daughter and the boy who had succeeded
      me. I said, &#8220;If you really want to know,- I can tell you why. He
      just didn&#8217;t have the money to do it the way she insisted on having
      it done, an expensive wedding, and all that.&#8221; She, the mother,
      already knew why I had first gracefully tapered off, and then backed away
      from it all&#8212;for the girl had told me that her penitent mother had
      wanted to kick herself for speaking out of turn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And the &#8220;Kid?&#8221; Well, wait and see. Might
      have to skip a few years, though. I had not yet made that stake. In
      reminiscing, one is permitted to wander about over all creation&#8212;provided,
      always, that he carries along for blending purposes at least one principal
      character already introduced: and makes sure to come back &#8220;home&#8221;
      before becoming hopelessly entangled in a wilderness of clearly unrelated
      matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The &#8220;Kid&#8221; figures prominently in this
      episode.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While in Kansas City, I ran onto a street hawker
      selling fake &#8220;diamonds&#8221; for one dollar each. Just for the fun
      of it, I bought one of the things, brought it home and presented it to
      Myrtle Mercer, who was now working in my printing office, merely to see
      how a diamond would affect a girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After showing me that her heart was in the right
      place, she darted out the door before I could stop her, ran down the steps
      to the Means store, and showed it to Lizzie Means; then beat it out the
      back door and ran across to show it to Mamma Alma. This lady was the wife
      of Dr. J. W. Graham.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mamma Alma was sharp as all getout. Lizzie Means was a
      shrewd business woman, but she had a less inquisitive mind. And I guess
      Myrtle was pretty sharp too, after the first ecstatic shock had passed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle came bounding back up to the office, and bawled
      me out: &#8220;Mr. Smartie, that is going to cost you a real diamond&#8212;and
      a good one, too! And I want it right now!&#8221; She had reason to believe
      I was holding out on her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;All right, all right&#8212;but you can&#8217;t
      have it now.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Cloy Weaver, my printer, who had been out on an errand,
      had come into the office by this time. He stood there with his mouth open,
      wondering what it was all about. Cloy had a girl in Stockton, California,
      and was aiming to leave the next day for California to marry her. As I
      needed him, and as he had told me he had a wife in the Philippines</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">he was a veteran of the Spanish
      American War&#8212; I tried to show him that this would be a bigamous
      trick. He agreed. Cloy was always agreeable. He remained with me a while
      longer&#8212;and married Edna Hudson.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Lizzie told me later in the day that the bogus diamond
      had her fooled, too. She laughed, &#8220;By golly, it did sparkle real
      prettily, didn&#8217;t it? But it&#8217;s going to cost you a real diamond&#8212;don&#8217;t
      forget that. Mamma Alma and I are not going to let Myrtle forget it
      either, Ough,&#8221; she shrugged, - &#8220;that was about the dirtiest
      trick imaginable. And Myrtle was so pleased! It was a shame!&#8221; And
      Mamma Alma had told Myrtle that it was high time anyway for me to be
      giving her a &#8220;real&#8221; diamond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The next morning Coral Locknane&#8212;Myrtle&#8217;s best
      friend</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">came to the office,
      and I don&#8217;t know what all passed between the two, but it is pretty
      certain they didn&#8217;t discuss trifles. The three of us went to Kansas
      City on the noon train. I said to the girls, &#8220;Shall we go to Cady
      &amp; Olmstead&#8217;s or to Jaccard&#8217;s?&#8221; I had been to both
      places on my last trip, and I knew they had just the right quality of
      sparklers to tickle a girl&#8217;s heart&#8212;now that I knew how a girl
      would react. But Myrtle, feeling pretty sure of herself, and in high good
      humor, said quite emphatically, &#8220;Neither.&#8221; She looked down the
      street and said, &#8220;We are going to Mercer&#8217;s on Petticoat Lane.
      It&#8217;s a name I believe I can trust. You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d
      let you steer me to a place like where you got that other thing?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When we went into the Mercer Store, Mr. Waddington,
      the diamond salesman, as it happened, pushed his portly self forward, and
      asked, &#8220;What will it be, please?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, pretty loudly, &#8220;A diamond ring for Miss
      Mercer!&#8221; That claimed the attention of the whole house&#8212;the
      proprietor included.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Coral had several pretty good diamonds of her own. She
      took a seat with Myrtle at the salestable in the little black velvet-lined
      cubby corner, while I stood back and looked on. When Mr. Waddington told
      them the price of the one they had selected, Myrtle exclaimed, &#8220;Whe-e-ew!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then she looked to me for approval. The modest, one
      carat blue white stone was in good taste, plenty big enough for a girl.
      Coral&#8217;s largest diamond&#8212;at that time&#8212;was also an even
      carat, and she was a great help to Myrtle in making the selection. Coral
      said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not good taste to have them too big.&#8221; Later,
      Myrtle said earnestly and very softly, as if the thing had taken her
      breath away, &#8220;Do you really think you want to stand that much?&#8221;
      Mercer&#8217;s was the highest priced shop in Kansas City&#8212;but in a
      case of this kind I figured that a girl must have what she wants.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Then we separated, and I went over to the Cady &amp;
      Olmstead store on the corner of 11th and Walnut, and bought for myself&#8212;or
      rather paid for what I had already bought</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">the beautiful blue white diamond, nearly twice as
      large, which Myrtle&#8217;s sister Jennie had helped me select only three
      days before. Jennie had warned me not to spring that fake diamond on
      Myrtle. Said it might not set just right with her. But I knew that Myrtle
      was too smart a girl to let anything make her mad at me for long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Cady said, &#8220;You are a day early&#8212;where&#8217;s
      the lady?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m early. Got
      pushed around a little. Never mind the lady now. Though you may still make
      it a Tiffany setting, but make it for this hand right here.&#8221; He gave
      me a sympathetic look. Mr. Cady was such a nice man that I felt duty bound
      to tell him, as nearly as I could, what had happened to the lady.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Sometimes even quality folk didn&#8217;t get to see
      Mr. Cady, in person. Well, I did&#8212;just like I said. I still have the
      sales ticket, dated May 12, 1903, bearing his notation, &#8220;Will
      exchange Tif. Belcher mounting without cost&#8212;or diamond for other
      goods any time without discount.&#8221; Signed, &#8220;Cady.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">All this was too much for Coral. A woman with money of
      her own can stand only so much. She went over to Norton&#8217;s&#8212;and
      bought herself another diamond, nearly twice as big as Myrtle&#8217;s. The
      satisfied expression on her lovely face was something to behold. My first
      thoughts were that this might call for me to do some swapping with Myrtle.
      But, no sir&#8212;she&#8217;d not part with hers. If pressed, she&#8217;d
      claim them both. Trust a woman!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We had to stay the night in Kansas City with Myrtle&#8217;s
      sisters, Jennie and Kathy. When she got the chance, Jennie asked me,
      &#8220;How did it work?&#8221; meaning the bogus diamond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Well,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;it looks like it
      hasn&#8217;t blown the top off anything yet.&#8221; She said, &#8220;It
      surely does look that way now, but I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure of it after
      she sees the beauty we picked out for her.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The two country girls had talked nothing but diamonds
      from the time they had entered the apartment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The next morning the three of us started out three
      ways to get our diamonds&#8212;only we didn&#8217;t do it just that way.
      We went the rounds in a group. Mr. Mercer told Miss Mercer that she had
      selected the best one-carat blue-white flawless diamond in his store. And
      he wondered if they might not be related. Myrtle came home pretty pleased
      for keeps that time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I&#8217;ve always counted it my best investment.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">There was, assuredly, need for the vigilantes at one
      time in the Far West, where the idea originated and here there were no

      organized government functioning normally and in most instances
      efficiently there in Nemaha County, there was, seemingly, no call here for
      the vigilantes when they hanged Charley Manley.</span>

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">My dear Mr. Bristow:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">We have just read with a great deal of interest
      your article in the Wetmore Spectator dealing with the hanging of Charley
      Manley. This is the first time I have ever heard of this act of the
      vigilantes. We are going to check through our files of April 1877 and see
      if we can find anything relating to it. In any event, I write to ask
      permission to reproduce this article in a much special issue of the
      Tribune we are putting out next year to celebrate Seneca&#8217;s 75th
      anniversary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">The article is so well written and deals with so
      early history of our county that I consider it admirably adapted to our
      purpose. The next time you are in &#8216;Seneca I should like to have you
      call at The Courier-Tribune office. I have no doubt you have a fund of
      other stories that would be just as interesting.</span>

    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Sincerely yours,</span>

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Geo. C. Adriance</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It is a tragic story</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">the hanging of Manley by the vigilantes. It was Mar. 31,
      1877. I was a small boy when I first knew Charley Manley, just about big
      enough to turn a grindstone, with effort. There is purpose in this
      reference to the grindstone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I remember the time very distinctly. And, with all due
      respect to the memory of my departed elders&#8212;the vigilantes&#8212;if,
      after so many years, I may be permitted to express myself freely and
      fully, I would say God seemed to be terribly far away from the scene that
      night. Before going into the details of the hanging, let us have a look
      into the workings of the vigilantes&#8212;that organization of men who set
      itself up as judge and jury and executioner. There was tactful veiling of
      the identity of the individual members, and little is known of the inside
      workings of the local vigilantes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">This much is known, however. There was one little slip</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">a bungle&#8212;that was, in time,
      the means of disclosing the identity of the local operators, but that
      secret was also carefully guarded until practically the last one of the
      vigilantes has passed on to another world beyond the reach of wagging
      tongues and the strong arm of organized law. There is now only one&#8212;possibly
      two&#8212;of the originals left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The vigilante organization or &#8220;Committee,&#8221;
      as it was called, had its birth in the Far West, for the specific purpose
      of dealing with &#8220;road agents&#8221;&#8212;banded highwaymen and
      murderers. The idea traveled East and the farther it got away from the
      home of its origin the farther it seems to have gotten away from its
      original purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the sixties and seventies vigilante committees were
      in evidence the full length of the old Overland Trail, from California to
      Kansas, and the fact that Wetmore and Granada had as residents a half
      dozen or so of the old stage-drivers, express messengers, and pony express
      riders, may account, in some measure, for the local organization of
      vigilantes. And, if so, by the irony of fate, it was in the home of a
      former express messenger that the vigilantes claimed their first and only
      victim. It is known that at least two of the old stage employees were
      vigilantes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Without question, the idea filtered in from the West. The
      almost constant stream of returning gold-seekers passing through Granada
      over the Old Trail at a time when the vigilantes were very active in the
      West</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">particularly in
      Montana&#8212;may have scattered the seed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While I was out in the western mining district, a
      quarter of a century ago, chasing fickle fortune&#8212;which was always
      just a few jumps ahead of me&#8212;I heard much about the exploits of road
      agents, and the work of the vigilantes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the Old West, at Bannack, Virginia City, and
      Nevada, in the Alder Gulch section of Montana, where a hundred million
      dollars in placer gold was recovered in the early sixties, road agents
      plundered and killed, without mercy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Placer gold, as many know, is free gold that has been
      eroded from exposed gold-bearing ledges and deposited in the sands and
      gravel along the water courses. It was the first form of gold-mining in
      the West&#8212;the lure that caused the great stampede to California in
      1849. It has rightfully been called &#8220;the poor man&#8217;s gold,&#8221;
      because of the comparative ease in which it is recovered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The flush times in the Alder Gulch section, which
      contained about twenty thousand eager gold diggers, made rich pickings for
      the road agents. They preyed upon individual miners, on express companies,
      on anyone, anywhere they could grab gold-dust, or minted gold, the money
      of the times. And they were killers, every one of them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Montana vigilantes, sworn to secrecy and loyalty,
      with a by-law boldly asserting, &#8220;The only punishment that shall be
      inflicted by this committee is Death,&#8221; undertook the job of
      exterminating the road agents. And in one month&#8217;s time twenty-one of
      the notorious Henry Plummer gang were hung. The job was pepped up a bit
      when the first victims squealed on the others. This is history of the
      Montana vigilantes. They patterned after the California vigilantes. And it
      is to be assumed that vigilantes everywhere were organized along the same
      lines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was a vigilante committee in Nemaha County at
      least nine years prior to the hanging of Manley. In September, 1868,
      Melvin Baughn, a horse-thief, was legally hanged at Seneca for killing
      Jesse Dennis, one of the deputized men who helped capture him. In writing
      of that hanging George Adriance said there was a vigilante committee at
      the time, and it wanted the officers to turn Baughn over to the committee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Manley and Joe Brown were charged with being
      implicated in stealing John O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s horse. O&#8217;Brien
      lived on the Dave Ralston place west of Granada and Brown lived on a
      quarter section of land west of the Charley Green farm in the Granada
      neighborhood, about two miles from the O&#8217;Brien farm. Charley Manley
      lived with the family of W. W. Letson at Netawaka. He had lived with the
      Letsons at Granada and at Wetmore before they moved to Netawaka. Letson
      and Spencer kept a general store here in the old corner building now owned
      by Cawood Brothers, originally built by Rising and Son.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At one of their meetings, it appears, the vigilantes
      decided to hang Manley and Brown. One member who lived close to Brown
      pleaded for the life of his neighbor. Brown had a family of small
      children. The discussion waxed hot</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">and there was a great rift in the personnel of the
      organization. They did not agree in the matter. The determined ones,
      however, went ahead with their plans for the hanging. And on the night of
      the execution some of the vigilantes, not in accord with the plan, spent
      the night at the homes of their neighbors so as to clear themselves of
      suspected participation in the hanging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Manley was arrested at Netawaka and was to
      have been given a preliminary trial in Justice H. J. Crist&#8217;s court
      at Granada. He was brought to Wetmore early the day of his execution and
      held under guard in the office of the old Wetmore House until evening. The
      delay supposedly was occasioned in order to bring Joe Brown to the bar of
      &#8220;justice&#8221; at the same time. Later it appeared the proceedings
      had been delayed, waiting for nightfall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Robert Sewell, constable, liveryman, ex-stage driver
      and Indian fighter, was the arresting officer. On the plains, and here, he
      was known as &#8220;Bob Ridley.&#8221; George G. Gill was deputized as
      assistant constable. Dr. J. W. Graham, a Justice of the Peace in Wetmore
      at the time, was appointed special prosecutor by County Attorney Simon
      Conwell. Sewell, Gill, and Graham, with Manley, drove to Granada in a
      spring wagon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the way to Granada, all unconscious of what was in
      the air, Dr. Graham, seeing a tree by the roadside with a large
      overhanging limb, jokingly said, &#8220;Whoa, stop the team, Bob&#8212;-we
      might just as well hang Charley right here.&#8221; Manley laughed and
      said, &#8220;Oh, no&#8212;let&#8217;s all have a drink.&#8221; He passed
      his bottle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Court was to have been held in the Hudson hotel at
      Granada. But before proceedings had started, the vigilantes, in
      black-face, with coats turned insideout, appeared upon the scene and began
      shooting up the place</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">with
      blanks. They seized Manley and rushed him away&#8212;to his doom.
      Pandemonium reigned, and in the excitement the president of the vigilante
      committee, it is said, raised a window and told Brown to &#8220;beat it.&#8221;
      So, it would seem, the neighbor&#8217;s plea for Brown&#8217;s life, while
      very costly to himself, as you shall see later, had made its impression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Earlier in the evening, one high up in vigilantic
      officialdom, had taken the precaution to relieve the three constables and
      the prosecuting attorney of their revolvers&#8212;borrowed them &#8220;for
      a few minutes.&#8221; Dr. Graham says he never did get his back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Manley was taken to a big tree down on the
      creek west of Granada, and strung up. The tree was on the old Terrill
      place, now owned by the Achtens. Monoah H. Terrill, a store-keeper at
      Granada, was a brother-in-law of Manley. Terrill had died a long time
      before the Manley hanging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Manley was buried on the Terrill place&#8212;or rather
      what afterwards proved to be the roadside&#8212;by the grave of his
      brother-in-law. Later the bodies were removed. Terrill was placed in the
      Letson lot in the Netawaka cemetery. Some say the body of Manley was also
      taken there. The Letson lot has no such marker. Others say he was
      re-buried in the northeast corner of the Granada cemetery. There is no
      marker or other visible evidence of his grave there. His grave now seems
      to be as irredeemably lost as was his life on that fatal March night
      fifty-four years ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is said by those who were in a position to speak at
      the time, that Manley made no protest, spoke not a word when the mob took
      him from the room. Whether it was sheer shock that robbed him of all power
      to speak, to think, to feel, no one knows. Dr. Graham says that after they
      started away with the prisoner someone fired a gun, and he heard Manley
      say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that boys, it&#8217;s not fair.&#8221; Just
      what happened after that was never made public. The knowing ones didn&#8217;t
      seem to want to talk. There were, however, many conflicting rumors afloat&#8212;sub
      rosa reports, you understand. One rumor was that Manley was dead before
      they left the main street with him&#8212;died from fright and rough
      handling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the way out one of the vigilantes lost his cap.
      Someone picked it up. The same man who had &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the
      officers guns, acting as rear guard, rode back and took the cap. He said
      to the people who had followed from the court room, &#8220;We don&#8217;t
      want to hurt anyone&#8212;but keep back.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Some of the men in that mob were recognized, but, as one
      old timer aptly puts it, no one at that time seemed to care a &#8220;helluva&#8221;
      lot about knowing who they were. However, as the veiling gradually lifted,
      it became known that the major portion of the respectable adult male
      citizens</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and a few bad
      eggs&#8212;were numbered among the vigilantes. They were, mostly,
      fair-minded and just men. But, even fair-minded men, under stress, can
      sometimes be auto-hypnotized into doing strange things&#8212;and it would
      seem some of the vigilantes got terribly out of hand that night. From all
      accounts the performance was a rather disgusting exhibition of mob
      passion. Later criticism of the vigilantes was based very largely on the
      inexcusable savage demonstration attending the Manley hanging. And mistake
      not, there was criticism&#8212;criticism that stirred the whole
      countryside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Vigilantes did not tell their wives everything. It
      might have been better if they had. And if the Manley demonstration had
      met with the approval of the good wives and mothers of the participating
      vigilantes, the women might have taken a hand in the general clean-up and
      scrubbed the burnt-cork, or whatever it was that blackened their faces,
      from back of the men&#8217;s ears and thus obliterated the telltale marks
      that lingered, like the itch, with some of the boys for several days. The
      women generally deprecated the hanging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Just what evidence the vigilantes had against Charley
      Manley, and how authentic or damaging it was, never was made public. Nor
      will it ever be. Had the vigilantes permitted the trial to progress far
      enough to establish the prisoner&#8217;s guilt, their actions would, no
      doubt, have received less criticism. The friends of the vigilantes&#8212;the
      vigilantes themselves never talked, as vigilantes&#8212;said that it would
      have been difficult to produce convicting evidence as Manley was too good
      at &#8220;covering up.&#8221; He was credited with being the &#8220;brains&#8221;
      of the gang.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Two business men in Netawaka were also suspected. They
      evaporated. In fact, there were a dozen or more men scattered about over
      the country who were under suspicion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was rather a hard proposition to handle. The
      farmers&#8212;the vigilantes and the farmers, with a sprinkling of town
      people, were practically the same&#8212;were terribly incensed because of
      the thefts of their horses, and they were determined, at any cost, to put
      a stop to it. And while the convicted horse-thief did not draw a death
      sentence, the courts were efficient enough and willing enough to impose
      ample punishment on offenders. But the real trouble was in getting
      convicting evidence. And the courts could not, of course, play &#8220;hunches&#8221;
      in so serious a matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And where convicting evidence was lacking, it would seem
      about the best&#8212;or worst&#8212;the vigilantes could do, was to make
      an example of some one of those under suspicion, and hope that they had
      hanged the right man</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">a
      rather dangerous procedure, and hardly sufficient excuse for taking a
      life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But one thing that worked then against bringing
      suspects into court was, that in case of failure to convict, the court
      costs were assessed to the complaining witness, and that meant a lot to
      the pioneer farmer&#8212;especially to one who had just lost his horses.
      At least, that is the way the John O&#8217;Brien complaint was handled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The old court record shows that Constable Sewell
      traveled twenty-four miles in making the arrest of Manley, for which he
      received $2.40. George G. Gill, as deputy, received a like sum. The
      attorney received $7.50. There was also a charge of $1.00 for the keep of
      the prisoner, and another $1.00 for guarding him. Isaiah Hudson traveled
      only six miles, three miles out and three miles back, in making the arrest
      of Joseph Brown, for which he received $1.20. One witness, J. W. Duvall,
      was subpoenaed in the Brown case. None in the Manley case. And,
      presumably, because of the disrupted court proceedings and the loss of the
      prisoners, it was &#8220;considered and adjudged&#8221; by the court that
      the costs in both cases be charged to John O&#8217;Brien, the complaining
      witness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, after the hanging of Manley, someone made a
      mistake&#8212;a very serious mistake&#8212;which, coupled with the
      previous disagreement, came very close to disrupting the vigilante
      organization. A letter, purporting to come from the vigilantes, was sent
      to the rebellious member. It gave the man ten days to leave the country,
      and warned him that if he failed to do so he would be given the same
      treatment as was meted out to Manley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This was a hard jolt to the obstreperous member. And
      it was a harder jolt for the man&#8217;s wife. The woman opened and read
      the letter first, and only for that she might never have known what it was
      that caused her man to so suddenly develop a bad case of ague. Then, every
      day, for weeks, as the gathering shades of night began to fall upon his
      home, this man, with his wife and three small children, trailed off
      through the woods, across lots, to the home of a relative to spend the
      night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That letter was the cause of much mental and even
      physical misery for the woman. She suffered heart attacks at the time: And
      in the weeks that followed she suffered the mental torments of the damned.
      In relating the matter to me very recently, she said, &#8220;Every time
      the dog barked I would have a fit.&#8221; According to her version of it,
      those were the blackest days of her life. And, like a scar, she will carry
      its horrors to her dying day&#8212;to the grave. She knew what a crazed
      mob was capable of doing. As a matter of fact, she knew what a guerilla
      mob had done to my father&#8217;s family.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Many, many were the times that my mother&#8212;sweet,
      patient, administering angel&#8212;was called upon to be with that woman
      in her hours of great distress. And once, when the insidious thing was
      about to consume her, my mother brought the woman home with her for a
      week.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The marked member finally took the matter up with other
      vigilantes, and to save the sanity of the man&#8217;s wife</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and no doubt to appease the man&#8217;s fears also</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">after all denying knowledge of the
      letter, the vigilantes signed a paper pledging protection to the man. The
      marked man</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and his friends
      in the organization&#8212;however, had a pretty good idea who wrote that
      letter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With such a document in evidence the identity of the
      vigilantes, which had been so closely guarded up to this time, was no
      longer cloaked. At least the veil of secrecy now had a big rip in it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The hanging of Manley had a tendency to slow up
      activities, but it did not stop the horse-stealing. And once more the
      Committee set out to make an example of an accused man. Frank Gage,
      charged with stealing a horse from Washie Lynn, was being tried in a
      Justice court somewhere over in the Powhattan neighborhood</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">probably Charley Smith&#8217;s court. The vigilantes
      were in readiness to &#8220;storm&#8221; the court and take the prisoner,
      as they had done in the Manley case at Granada, but the plan was abandoned
      at the last minute.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Two horsemen, young and daring, with a whiff of what
      was in the air, made a hurried run to the scene. They told the vigilantes
      that they were about to make a mistake&#8212;that they, the informers,
      knew positively that Gage was elsewhere the night the Lynn horse was
      stolen. The high-stepping modern Paul Revere of that heroic dash still
      lives. The other has gone to his reward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Gage, of course, was acquitted, for lack of evidence.
      Later, the real thief, convicted for stealing wheat, confessed to stealing
      the Lynn horse, and told where it was. Washie reclaimed the animal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The man who was credited with being the president of
      the vigilante committee afterwards became a very popular and efficient
      peace officer of Nemaha county. And, if I understood the man rightly, I
      think he would have fought forty wildcats, and maybe a buzz-saw or two,
      before he would have surrendered, for unlawful handling, a charge of his
      to any set of men&#8212;vigilantes, clan, mob extraordinary, or even a
      regiment of soldiers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Soon after the Manley hanging a branch of the Kansas
      Peoples Detective Association was organized here. Unlike the vigilantes,
      its purpose was not to override the law, but to assist it in capturing and
      convicting horse-thieves. W. D. Frazey was president and E. J. Woodman was
      secretary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now a line about the Old Overland Trail. Besides
      carrying a faint flavor of Manley handiwork, it was the avenue by which I
      myself came into this country. But I did not ride the old Concord coach
      drawn by its four spirited horses. I came by the slower mode of the
      ox-team.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Old Overland Trail, or military road, as it was
      sometimes called, was vastly different from the good roads of the present
      time&#8212;very, very much different from the elaborate specifications for
      Number Nine, now building through Wetmore. It was little more than a wide
      rut worn deep by the constant movement of horse-drawn vehicles, including,
      of course, mules and oxen. There were stage-lines, pony-express riders,
      and heavy freighting outfits. The commerce of the West was handled over
      the Old Trail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Starting at Atchison, the Old Trail came into the Pow~
      hattan ridge settlement at the southwest corner of the Kickapoo Indian
      reservation, and, keeping to the high ridges as much as practical, it
      passed through Granada, Log Chain and Seneca, and on westward to Oroville
      and Sacramento, in California. The stage company maintained a change
      station on the old Collingwood C. Grubb farm&#8212;called Powhattan. Noble
      H. Rising was in charge of the station after it had been moved three miles
      north, and the name changed to Kickapoo. His son, Don C. Rising, was a
      pony-express rider. W. W. Letson was express messenger. Bill Evans, Lon
      Huff, and Bob Sewell, oldtimers here, were stage drivers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The road made a sharp turn to the north before
      reaching Granada. Peter Shuemaker lived on the farm now owned and occupied
      by Charley Zabel, west of the turn. Shuemaker wanted the road to pass by
      his farm, and, at his own expense, built a cut-off in the hope that
      traffic would be diverted that way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Roads in those days were built, mostly, by the simple
      process of going out with a plow and running a couple of parallel furrows,
      with the proper spacing to accommodate all anticipated traffic. Peter
      Shuemaker&#8217;s cut-off veered off to the northwest, across the prairies
      just anywhere the going seemed to be good, until it intersected the Old
      Trail again. And though as simple as that, road building in those days was
      not without difficulties. Some would want the road and some wouldn&#8217;t
      want it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter&#8217;s road bumped into a
      circumstance when his engineer projected the cut-off across the farm of a
      certain female importation from the Emerald Isle. And right there Irish
      wit and Missouri temper mixed. William Porter, not so very long removed
      from the Rushville hills, was chief engineer and contractor for the
      prairie division of &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter&#8217;s cut-off. Mrs.
      Flannigan met the Missourian head-on, with an old horse-pistol wrapped in
      her apron. &#8220;Off with you, I&#8217;ll not have the place torn up,&#8221;
      she commanded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Entirely unaware of the</span> <span>ominous</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">clouds rolling up in the sky of his destiny, the wily
      William squared himself in an attitude of defiance, squinted his eyes in
      the peculiar manner of his people, spat out his tobacco, and said, &#8220;I
      carkilate I&#8217;m running this road.&#8221; Whereupon Mrs. Flannigan
      unbound her pistol, and replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine young man you
      are, but I&#8217;m sorry to tell you that you&#8217;ll never see your old
      mother again.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Contractor Porter decided to take fate in his own
      hands and change the plans of destiny as decreed by Mrs. Flannigan. He
      took another chew of tobacco and then meekly backtracked for a mile over
      the perfectly good road he had just built&#8212;and ran some more furrows.
      You couldn&#8217;t block a road project with a horse-pistol, or even with
      injunctions, in those days. There was too much open land.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The generous spacings and fine appointments of Peter
      Shuemaker&#8217;s cut-off&#8212;it had a corduroy bridge, over Muddy
      Creek, with nigger-head trimmings&#8212;were out of all proportion to the
      scanty travel that passed his way. And when &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter
      found that he couldn&#8217;t bring the traffic to him, he, like Mahomet,
      went to it. Shuemaker built a hotel in Granada.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Recollections are now about as dim as the Old Trail
      itself, but there is one oldtimer who asserts that it is his belief that
      Ice Gentry and Charley Manley were credited with being the axe-men who
      made the slashings on the timber division of &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Peter&#8217;s
      cut-off. But, says another, that may have been before Manley came into the
      neighborhood. Nothing certain about that, though. So many of the old
      fellows have their biographies so scrambled that it is hard to get at the
      truth. The suggestion was, nevertheless, timely. And, anyway, Charley
      Manley spent his last day on earth in Peter Shuemaker&#8217;s hotel at
      Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">As I remember him, Charley Manley was a rather quiet,
      pleasant mannered man. And, although a matured man himself</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">he was about forty, and unmarried</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">he made friends of the youngsters about town and
      seemed to enjoy their company. He could always find a way to help a boy
      with a few dimes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Early in his career here in Wetmore it was settled
      that I was to have the job of turning the grindstone for Charley Manley
      whenever he needed help to grind his axe. Since that time I have often
      wondered why he had so much axe-grinding to do. But I thoroughly enjoyed,
      with all the thankfulness of a growing young boy&#8217;s&#8221; healthy
      heart, the dimes and quarters he gave me. And sometimes I have thought
      that maybe he ran in a few extra and needless grindings solely to gladden
      my heart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then came the time when Charley Manley fitted his
      grindstone with foot pedals. I used to sit by and watch him do the
      grinding without my help, and long for the dime I was being cheated out of
      by the introduction of that new labor-saving device. One time Charley
      Manley let me pour water on the grindstone while he ran it with
      foot-power. He said the tin can suspended over the stone, which was
      releasing a steady stream of water where it was needed, did not do the
      work so satisfactorily. He gave me a quarter for that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With all his axe-grinding, I never knew Charley Manley
      to do more than chop wood on the Letson wood-pile. No coal was burned here
      in that axe-grinding period. Wood was brought in from the timber, a
      wagon-load at a time, in the pole, or in cord-wood lengths. It was chopped
      into stove lengths as needed, enough to cook a meal at a time. And
      sometimes the chopper would make the supply very scanty, or even renege on
      the job altogether. Then the cook would have to go out and scrape up
      chips. How well I know that. Aside from my axe-grinding activities I spent
      some time on the Bristow wood-pile in my younger days. And I am now sorry
      to say there were times when my patient mother would have to gather in the
      chips.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The last words Charley Manley ever said to me were,
      &#8220;Come over to Netawaka and see me sometimes, Johnny, and I&#8217;ll
      let you turn the grindstone for me.&#8221; He smiled pleasantly. That was
      while he was held in custody here the day of his execution. Poor fellow,
      he did not then suspect what was to be his fate. Naturally, I felt badly
      about the hanging&#8212;and the loss of my opportunity to make another
      honest dime. And the worst that I could now wish for the shades of his
      executioners, is that they be compelled to take turns in turning Manley&#8217;s
      grindstone, over there in the vast beyond, until his axe is made sharp,
      sharp, sharp&#8212;and then, that Charley&#8217;s ghost be licensed by Him
      who judges all things, to use it&#8212;provided, of course, that he didn&#8217;t
      steal their horses.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was sixty-two years ago. Our quiet little village,
      surrounded by almost continuous open country, with grazing herds all
      bedded down for the night, slumbered. A gentle rain was falling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The night train brought to Wetmore a man bent upon a
      desperate undertaking. Jim Erickson was a resident of these parts, but had
      been absent for some time. He did not seek lodgings in town. Under cover
      of the night he walked west on the railroad track for two miles, then
      turned off to the timber on the south. He spent the remainder of the night
      in a hay stack at the timber&#8217;s edge. Here he loaded his revolver for
      the cold-blooded murder of his neighbor and supposedly his friend, Adolph
      Marquardt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With the coming of dawn on that spring morning, May
      10, 1873, Jim Erickson-plodded on foot through the wet grass from his
      hay-stack bed to the Marquardt home two miles to the southwest. He knocked
      for admittance. The door was opened. Erickson&#8217;s gun flashed, and
      Marquardt fell dead by the side of the door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Just what all happened after that is mere conjecture</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but rumor had it that the whole
      abominable affair rested with Erickson&#8217;s burning desire to break the
      Tenth Commandment; and as expedient to this insane impulse he deemed it
      important for him to break also the Sixth Commandment. And as it turned
      out, he just about smashed the whole category of &#8220;Thou shall nots.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jim Erickson took the two small Marquardt children
      over to the home of Peter Nelson about a quarter of a mile away. He told
      Nelson that he had killed Marquardt; that he had shot Mrs. Marquardt in
      the thigh, crippling her, so that she could not get away, and that he
      intended to kill her when he returned to the home. Erickson also told
      Nelson that he had intended to take Mrs. Marquardt away with him, but she
      had refused to go.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It was never definitely established that there had been
      any promises or understanding between Erickson and Mrs. Marquardt. If
      there had been any clandestine meetings, they had the good sense, or more
      likely the good luck, to keep it well under cover. The one certain thing
      is that Erickson coveted his neighbor&#8217;s wife</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and that was bad business.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Marquardt children were too young to realize what
      had happened. The older child, a boy of four, could say nothing but
      &#8220;Boom!&#8221; The younger child died two years later in the home of
      William Morris.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The older boy</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">now
      Adolph Nissen</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">still lives.
      He was taken into the home of Christian C. Nissen. Or rather, the Nissens
      came to the boy&#8217;s home, acquiring the right through due process of
      law. And they adopted the boy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Marquardts were regarded as fine people, and if
      there had ever been any rifts in the family, the world did not know it.
      Jim Erickson was a rather quiet and apparently honorable man who owned a
      homestead north of the Marquardt home. The Marquardt land is now owned by
      Mrs. C. C. Nissen, Christian&#8217;s second wife, mother of Frits Nissen,
      and C. C.&#8217;s other four children&#8212;Bill, Homer, George, and Mrs.
      Charley Love. Peter Nelson owned the intervening eighty then. Erickson was
      a bachelor. The residents of that settlement were all countrymen. That is,
      they or their ancestors had immigrated to this country from that little
      corner of the old world known as the land of the midnight sun&#8212;Sweden,
      Norway, and Denmark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There were no telephones then and the process of
      summoning the law was necessarily slow. William Liebig was constable. He
      was reputedly a very brave man, but that was one time when he displayed
      more caution than |. bravery. With a posse of deputized men, Liebig went
      to the scene of the murder&#8212;that is, they went near it. For long
      hours the men hung around on the fringe of the premises, watching and
      waiting. Finally Liebig crept noiselessly up to the house and very
      cautiously pushed the door open. His tension relaxed a bit. All occupants
      of the house were dead. Jim Erickson had killed Mrs. Marquardt while in
      bed. He then sent a bullet through his own head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At that time there was a small publication at Netawaka
      whose outspoken editor believed in calling &#8220;a spade a spade.&#8221;
      His printed version of the affair, purporting to be based on revealments
      in the house on entry of the officers, was, to say the least, racily
      rotten.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Erickson&#8217;s body was brought to town and rested
      for a while in the wareroom of the DeForest store building. The doctors
      sawed Erickson&#8217;s head open, and decided that he had an &#8220;abnormal
      brain.&#8221; But evidently they were not satisfied with their findings.
      Anyhow, it would seem they craved another whack at him, as will be
      observed later. In making the post-mortem the doctors used a common
      carpenter&#8217;s hand saw. I saw them do it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Marquardt and his wife were buried in the Wetmore
      cemetery. Marquardt was a Union soldier. His grave is marked with a slab
      bearing only his name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">There was no one here to claim Jim Erickson&#8217;s body.
      Neil Erickson, a cousin, lived in that neighborhood&#8212;but the crime
      was too horrible for him to have any part in the disposal of the murderer.
      Neil Erickson was a respected citizen. Neil later married Peter Pope&#8217;s
      widow. She was the sister of a Wetmore shoemaker named Reuter. Pope gave
      Reuter a cow for bringing his sister here&#8212;as a prospective bride&#8212;besides
      paying the woman&#8217;s way from Germany. She took with her into the
      Erickson home one child</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Charley.
      I do not know if Charley was her son, or Peter Pope&#8217;s by his first
      wife. Likely the former. Pope had a daughter&#8212;Louise. She was old
      enough at her father&#8217;s death to make her own way. She worked in Dr.
      J. W. Graham&#8217;s home for several years. Neil Erickson was the father
      of Dick Erickson. Jim Erickson&#8217;s brother George came later, and
      lived here many years. He was an honorable man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The town people decided that they did not want a murderer
      buried in the cemetery, so what was left of Jim Erickson after the doctors
      had finished with him, was dumped into a packing box, and he was buried on
      top of a high hill just south of town. This hill, then regarded as &#8220;no
      man&#8217;s land,&#8221; is now a part of the Bartley farm. It has been
      locally known ever since as Mount Erickson.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the night following the planting of Erickson, two
      groups of doctors, with numerous assistants, started out to recover the
      body. But, as it turned out, the corpse was left undistributed&#8212;at
      least, for that night. Rumor had it that it did not remain long on the
      hill-top.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Wetmore group, led by Dr. W. F. Troughton, was first
      in the field. Close on their heels came the Netawaka group. Dusk was upon
      them. One of the Netawaka men rode a white horse. That rider and his
      companions moved silently across the slough-grass swamp skirting the big
      hill, steadily gaining on the Wetmore men who had halted at the base of
      the hill. One of the local hirsute sentinels</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">they nearly all wore whiskers then&#8212;exclaimed,
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a ghost!&#8221; That was enough. The Wetmore group
      stampeded. The Netawaka group followed suit. And the cattle which had
      bedded down for the night at the base of the hill stampeded. The cattle
      bellowed, and what with terrified men and frightened beasts running this
      way and that way, pandemonium reigned supreme for quite a spell. Perhaps
      the cattle, too, had seen Erickson&#8217;s ghost.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">STATEMENT BY CHARLES H. BROWNE</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Editor Horton Headlight</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE&#8212;Nearly a year ago, J. T.
      Bristow, pioneer resident of Wetmore and former editor of the Wetmore
      Spectator, promised Charles H. Browne, editor of The Headlight at Horton,
      Kansas, he would prepare an article dealing with early history of this
      corner of Kansas, particularly as it was affected by the Old Military
      Road, which became the Overland Stage route to the Far West and also the
      Pony Express route.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was hoped Mr. Bristow would have the article ready
      for the 50th Anniversary edition of The Headlight, published on October
      29, 1936, but this he was unable to do. However, he furnished the article
      several months later, and The Headlight published it in seven
      installments.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The article is so unusually well written, so
      authentic, and of such absorbing interest that the editor has taken the
      liberty of reproducing it in a small booklet in order that it may better
      be preserved for its historical importance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Kansas pioneers living in south-central Nemaha and
      southern Brown counties a little more than three-quarters of a century
      ago, witnessed the inauguration of a stage line over an old trail passing
      their very doors, so to speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That road, thick with horse and mule drawn vehicles
      and long ox-drawn wagon trains, grew quickly into the greatest
      thoroughfare of its kind on the face of the earth. Simply a winding trail,
      ungraded and almost wholly without bridges, it was by far the greatest
      line of vehicular traffic of all times. It was a road with a golden
      background. It is the major topic of this article.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At that time there were no railroads or telegraph
      lines west of the Missouri river. A vast wilderness, uninhabited except
      for Indians and a few isolated white settlements, all territory between
      the river and the Rocky mountains was designated as &#8220;The Great
      American Desert.&#8221; By many it was considered the most worthless
      stretch of country in the western world. An error, of course, and one
      agreeably noted by those living here now&#8212;notwithstanding the New
      Deal brain trust&#8217;s prophecy that much of this land is to revert to
      the desert.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">W. F. Turrentine, in Spectator</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">A few days ago J. T. Bristow received a letter from
      Albert T. Reid, national vice-chairman of The American Artists
      Professional League, Incorporated, complimenting</span> <span>him</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">on his article, &#8220;The Overland Trail,&#8221; and
      asking for information regarding &#8220;Old Bob Ridley,&#8221; a famous
      frontiersman well known to what few of the old settlers are left in this
      vicinity. &#8220;Old Bob Ridley&#8221; was Robert Sewell who lived in this
      part of Kansas in an early day and had a lot of vivid experiences, some of
      which Mr. Bristow recorded in the article mentioned. Robert Sewell&#8217;s
      wife, several years his junior, was a sister of Mrs. V. O. Hough. We quote
      the following from Mr. Reid&#8217;s letter to Mr. Bristow:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">16 Georgia Ave., Long Beach, N. Y., November 14,
      1937.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Dear Mr. Bristow:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c6 c0 c13">Ralph Tennal of Sabetha sent me your story,
      &#8220;The Old Overland Trail,&#8221; a few days ago and I read it from
      kiver to kiver without stopping to catch my breath. It is very fascinating
      and a swell job.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">I was particularly interested in it because I had
      done a sketch which I intended painting sometime. I made the sketch about
      two years ago and from my memory of the incident which fascinated me
      particularly. I called it &#8220;Old Bob Ridley Brings in the Mall.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Recently I put a mural in place in the Post Office
      at Sabetha which was called &#8220;The Coming of the New Fast Mail.&#8221;
      It is of the Pony Express rider passing the old Mail Stage. It has made a
      hit far beyond my wildest hopes and leads me to believe this is the sort
      of thing the public likes, and particularly our Kansas people&#8212;they
      like something which is out of their past, realistic, romantic, colorful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c6 c0">Possibly you may remember me as the fellow who
      published the Leavenworth Daily Post for 18 1/2 years and the Kansas
      Farmer for almost eleven years during that period. I started to stick type
      on the Clyde papers. Was born up in Concordia and I never saw a railroad
      train until I was well up to six</span> <span class="c6">&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">just my father&#8217;s old stages which ran from
      Concordia to Waterville and Marysville.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">So you see why the painting of our old past
      particularly interests me and why I have a considerable first hand
      knowledge and feeling for it. The details are most important to me. I made
      a most careful research for my Pony Express and I want to be very accurate
      with Old Bob when I start in to paint it. There are a few details I want
      to get straightened out, so I am imposing on you to help me, thinking you
      may have some interest in seeing the incident preserved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">I gave Mr. Reid the information he desired, but I
      do not know if he ever finished a canvass of &#8220;Old Bob.&#8221;
      Probably not&#8212;for it was my impression (from reading between the
      lines) that if and when it should be completed that I would be expected to
      approve it, in return for his compliment to me. Bob&#8217;s home town
      would have been the natural place to exhibit it. Albert was concerned most
      as to whether the stage-team driven by Bob at the time of the Indian
      attack near Cottonwood Springs, in which he killed three Redskins and
      wounded a dozen more, were horses or mules. I said in my story that
      &#8220;Ben Holladay gave him a gold watch for saving the stage and the
      four mules.&#8221; And this was Bob&#8217;s version of it. So I gathered
      that Mr. Reid had this incident in mind for his painting. Only recently,
      Dec. 10, 1950, the Topeka Daily Capital ran a story, with illustration of
      a canvass by Albert T. Reid, &#8220;Main Street&#8212;1873&#8221; of the
      Artist&#8217;s old home town, featuring his father&#8217;s four-horse
      stage coach on the takeoff from Concordia. The Capital article said the
      women&#8217;s organizations of Concordia were raising a fund of $1,500 to
      purchase the canvass.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c6 c0">Bob Ridley (Robert Sewall) brought his colorful record
      with him when he came to Wetmore. Here, he was just like everyone else&#8212;maybe
      a little more so. He took life easy, did not brag overly much about his
      past exploits. Early in his career as stage driver on the Overland Trail,
      he fell into the habit of helping a red headed girl wait table at Mrs. D.
      M. Locknane&#8217;s celebrated eating house just west of Granada, grabbing
      bites now and again from his plate in the kitchen, as he worked, all
      through the twenty minute stops&#8212;and when this got monotonous he
      pepped up matters by grabbing the redhead, all in one take. He</span>
      <span class="c6">married</span> <span class="c6 c0">Cicily Locknane&#8212;and
      established her in an eating house of their own at a station in the Little
      Blue valley</span> <span class="c6">west of</span> <span class="c6 c0">Marysville,
      while he himself continued driving stage. But the frequent Indian raids in
      that section soon sent Cicily back to</span> <span class="c6">her mother</span>
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">at Granada. Then, when there was no more stage
      driving, Bob and Cicily moved down from Granada to Wetmore. Their
      activities here have been noted in other articles. Robert Sewell died in
      1884.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">J. T. B.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Overland Trail, along which the mighty traffic of
      the plains moved, was first laid out from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Kearney
      in 1849. The road was definitely established in 1858, with a weekly mail
      route from Saint Joseph to Salt Lake. In its settled state, the line ran
      daily from Atchison to Placerville, and Sacramento, California.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Prior to that the route through this section was used
      by gold-seekers, following the discovery of gold in California in 1849. It
      was used by emigrants, trappers, and adventurers coming from the East.
      Military stores from Fort Leavenworth to the posts in the northwest were
      handled over this trail. Also, freighting by ox-train was carried on
      extensively from Leavenworth to the Mormon settlements in the Salt Lake
      valley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mormons, too, may have traveled the road. And, as has
      been asserted in print, Mormons there might have been who camped in a
      clump of timber a few miles west of Atchison, causing it to be locally
      known as &#8220;Mormon Grove.&#8221; Straggling Mormons, maybe. But not
      the main exodus. Contrary to fixed assumption, the great migration of
      Mormons to the Salt Lake valley in 1847 did not pass this way. Driven out
      of Missouri, they went to Illinois; and again driven out of Illinois, they
      traveled through Iowa, crossed the Missouri river at Council Bluffs and
      did not touch ground on which the Old Trail was subsequently established
      until they reached the Platte valley at or near Fort Kearney. The offense
      that had so incensed the righteous citizens of Missouri and Illinois was
      flagrant polygamy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The main group of Mormons camped for nearly two years
      in Iowa while Brigham Young, with a few of his disciples, went on farther
      west is search of a place outside the United States where he hoped they
      could carry on without interference. The Salt Lake valley was then in
      Mexican territory. But almost before Brigham&#8217;s people had become
      settled the war with Mexico was over and Brigham&#8217;s refuge was ceded
      to the &#8220;hated&#8221; United States. Then for years the enormous
      migration across the plains to California poured through the land of
      mormon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Brigham didn&#8217;t relish that&#8212;and in the
      following decade he kicked up quite a disturbance. On every hand, he
      showed his hatred of all peoples not Mormon. He climaxed matters with the
      Meadow Mountain massacre. In 1857 the Mormons plundered and murdered an
      emigrant train numbering nearly 150 people. To be exact&#8212;a historical
      fact&#8212;120 men and women were slaughtered. Seventeen children under
      seven years of age were taken alive into Mormon camp. Also rumors, and
      some overt acts, indicated that the Mormons were planning rebellion. This
      bit of history is related merely to clarify statements which follow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now the Old Trail through this section came into
      active use again. General Albert Sidney Johnson&#8217;s army of 5,000 men,
      with a long ox-train bearing military supplies, was sent out from Fort
      Leavenworth to put down the so-called Mormon uprising. And, incidentally,
      that new mail route through here was to give quicker service between
      Washington and General Johnson. Prior to that, mail went to Salt Lake and
      the northwest forts monthly, out of Independence, up the Kaw valley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">All this business about the Old Trail happened of
      course before my day. True, I came into this country over the Old Trail&#8212;when
      traffic was at its peak&#8212;but I was too young to note much. Therefore,
      in compiling this article I must draw from memory of what I have read, of
      what was told in my presence, by old-timers after the closing years,
      together with what I have been able to pick up at this late date&#8212;and
      from what I really know about subsequent incidents that shall be given
      consideration. It is not alone the story of the Old Trail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I know of no old-timer from whom I could have obtained
      more reliable information than from my Uncle Nick Bristow. His first-hand
      knowledge of the Old Trail, and of the early history of the West, is
      reflected throughout this article.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My uncle, Nicholas Bristow, who died here November 12,
      1890, age 69 years, came to Kansas before the Old Trail was in active
      existence&#8212;just how early, I do not know. When my father wrote his
      brother from their old home in Tennessee, he would send his letters in
      care of the Floyds at old Doniphan, a steamboat landing on the Missouri
      river about five miles north of Atchison. How often my uncle would get his
      mail depended upon how often he drove his lumbering ox-team across the
      forty mile stretch of intervening prairies to the river for supplies.
      Uncle Nick kept that yoke of oxen a long time. I remember seeing him break
      prairie with old Buck and Jerry, two rangy Texas steers with long
      spreading horns tipped with brass knobs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And when my Uncle Nick wrote his cousin, Stephen
      Sersene, in California to ask, in substance, if he were really finding the
      gold&#8212;the lure that had snatched the said relative from his old
      Kentucky home and sent him scampering across the plains to the Pacific
      slope in 1849&#8212;and could he himself, should he go out there, stand a
      reasonable show of filling his own poke with gold-nuggets, he posted that
      letter at old Doniphan and it went to California by way of the Isthmus of
      Panama.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Had Uncle Nick been so fortunate as to get that letter
      in the mails so as to reach the Atlantic seaboard in time to connect with
      a semi-monthly sailing it would have reached his cousin Steven in about
      thirty days. With the inauguration of the Central Overland Stage Line,
      letters mailed at Granada or old Powhattan were taken through to the
      western coast in seventeen days&#8212;and later, by Pony Express, in ten
      days. Now, if he were living, my uncle could have his letters delivered in
      California by air-mail in ten hours. Thus have we progressed! Now, too, as
      all know, with three enabling devices, one can telegraph, talk, and sing
      to California, at will&#8212;and, if your photograph is of importance to
      the news service, it can, within certain bounds, be wired to California at
      the rate of an inch a minute for the breadth of the finished picture.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And had my uncle decided to go to California, the
      Isthmus route would have been his quickest and best way, if not the only
      safe way. However, notwithstanding the perils and delays of overland
      travel, more than a hundred thousand people crossed the plains in the
      first two years of the gold rush&#8212;many of them passing this way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our former townsman, Sneathen Vilott, whose home was
      then in Illinois, and who came to Kansas in 1855, went to California by
      way of the Isthmus of Panama during the gold excitement. I have often
      heard him talk entertainingly about that experience. Also, William J.
      Oliphant, father of Mrs. Robert T. Bruner, of Granada, went overland to
      California in 1849, and returned by way of the Isthmus. However, the
      goddess of gold did not smile upon either of these men. Indeed, they both
      worked in menial pursuits to earn return passage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Like nearly every one else in those days, Uncle Nick
      was gold-minded. He coveted some of that gold. In fact, we all did in our
      day&#8212;uncle, father, brother, and I.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With sails all set for California and the placers, my
      father, William Bristow, actually got out as far as Kansas in 1856. But
      someone in old Doniphan, a relative of the Floyds who had been to
      California, took the wind out of his sails with a negative report. My
      father was then twenty-one years old. He visited his brother here, then
      went back to Nashville, got married, and came out here again with his
      family in 1865. He finally went to California to live out his last years.
      He died at Fresno in 1908.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">In California, my father did not take up the hunt for
      gold&#8212;though, on one occasion when I was visiting him, he drove with
      me over to the old site of Millerton, which was one of the rich placers in
      the early days. It is where the San Joaquin river comes down out of the
      mountains. The only remaining evidence of that once hell-roaring town of
      10,000 inhabitants is the old territorial jail, a large stone building
      with heavily barred windows and three foot walls</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">a relic of the wicked past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While standing on the west bank of that swift flowing
      stream, watching the foaming waters among the boulders rush past, my
      father, pulling at his own whiskers in a sort of meditative way, said,
      with apparent regret, &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for that old
      long-whiskered cuss back there at Old Doniphan, I might have been out here
      when there was something doing; and probably&#8221;&#8212;he glanced
      toward the old jail which was then closed to the public&#8212;&#8221;have
      gotten to see the inside of that building.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While at old Millerton my father told me that my
      brother Dave, then in business in Fresno, had sent a representative and
      $5,000 into the Klondike country. In passing, I may say here that my
      brother&#8217;s five &#8220;grand&#8221; found a permanent home in the
      frozen north. Also, the miner sent to Alaska on a grubstake agreement got
      back within two years with nothing more than a sizable tale of hardships&#8212;and
      ten frosted toes. Julius Pohl, from Horton; Col. Ed. Post, from Atchison;
      and Sam Ebelmesser, formerly of Wetmore, now living in Los Angeles, were
      in that frenzied, frozen, Alaskan gold rush. Also, my brother Dave had
      some non-productive experience in seeking &#8220;black gold&#8221; in the
      Bakersfield oilfield&#8212;$15,000 worth of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My Uncle Nick was a Union soldier in the Civil war,
      and before that a soldier in the Mexican war of 1848&#8212;the war that
      dashed the heaven out of Brigham&#8217;s haven. Also, in a way, he was a
      soldier of fortune. He hunted gold, and he hunted mountain lions in the
      Rockies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But Uncle Nick did not go to California. Almost before he
      had had time to hear from his cousin Steve, he got his chance to dig for
      gold&#8212;and strange as it may appear, it was in Kansas! My uncle was
      among the first at the sensational Cherry</span> <span>c</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">reek gold diggings&#8212;the present site of Denver&#8212;in
      1858, advertised at the time in the East as the gold-fields of western
      Kansas. For want of a better known landmark, probably, the scene of that
      gold strike was inaccurately laid in the shadow of Pike&#8217;s Peak.
      Though visible on clear days, through the sun-drenched haze that lies
      always, like a pall, over the mountain fastness, Pike&#8217;s Peak is a
      good hundred miles south of Denver. But that gold find was truly in
      Kansas. At that time Kansas territory extended west to the backbone of the
      Rocky mountains. The city of Denver&#8212;first called Auraria&#8212;scene
      of the Cherry creek placers, was named after the territorial Governor of
      Kansas&#8212;James W. Denver.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Uncle Nick located a claim at the Cherry creek
      diggings and sent home to my aunt Hulda a small bottle of gold-dust,
      saying in a letter to her that she was &#8220;no longer a poor man&#8217;s
      wife!&#8221; That was, as my aunt afterwards said, a &#8220;sorry&#8221;
      thing to do&#8212;like giving a reprieve to a condemned man, and then
      revoking it. My uncle brought home no gold. He must have neglected his
      claim for the more hazardous business of hunting mountain lions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That ferocious beast, if you don&#8217;t know, is the
      big cat with four names. In the East and South he is the panther. In the
      Rockies he is the mountain lion. In Arizona and on the Pacific slope he is
      the cougar. Somewhere he is the puma. And everywhere he is the killer!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">No Government bounty was paid on cougars then, as there
      is now; but the pelts were much in demand for rugs. Hunters went after the
      lions for the same reason that early-day trappers sought the beaver. I
      recall that the lion rug in my uncle&#8217;s home, measuring eight feet
      from tip to tip, with stuffed head and artificial eyes&#8212;a trophy of
      his Rocky mountain hunts, killed at the risk of his own life, was a scary
      thing. The great beast was shot in the nick of time</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">in mid-air, after that two hundred pounds of</span> <span>destruction</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">had made the spring for my uncle from an overhanging
      limb of a great pine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And, incidentally, I might say my father had some
      terrifying experience with that killer, the panther. He was walking
      through the dark woods in his native Tennessee, nearing his home, when a
      night prowler fell in behind him, coming so close that he could feel the
      animal&#8217;s breath on his swinging hands, and he thought nothing of it&#8212;just
      then. Likely one of his dogs come to meet him. But in the yard, he could
      see by the light of the lamp in the window, which my mother was always
      careful to put there to show him that he would not be trespassing on the
      home of a wicked woman living in a lonely cabin in the nearby deep wood&#8212;a
      witch, they called her; but there was suspicion that she was more than
      that to some of the menfolk&#8212;he could see that his trailer was a
      panther. It had feasted on the offals from the day&#8217;s hog-killing, or
      butchering&#8212;and, with a bellyful, was in a rather composed mood. Not
      so my Dad. Did he run? He did not. He had learned from old hunters to not
      show fright when in a tight spot with that ugly animal. However, he said
      his stimulated mind reached the door about twenty &#8220;shakes of a sheep&#8217;s
      tail&#8221; ahead of his paralyzed legs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Uncle Nick&#8217;s recounted experiences with the lions
      were enough to fire the hunting blood in his young nephew. Later, however,
      the nephew going over the same ground said to himself, &#8220;To hell with
      the lions&#8212;me for the gold!&#8221; The contagion had gotten me.
      Recounting the great wealth of the five major placers, I &#8220;cussed&#8221;
      myself&#8212;mildly, of course</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">for not having been born earlier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Too late for the placers, and thoroughly imbued with
      the idea, I took a dip at hard-rock mining&#8212;and, paradoxically,
      &#8220;cussed&#8221; myself again. Less mildly, however. Ah, that delving
      for gold&#8212;it is a dramatic game, a business wherein the element of
      chance runs rampant and the imagination is given unbridled play.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Bedeviled by Indians and highwaymen, there were perils
      and hardships in travel along the Overland Trail in those days&#8212;but
      nothing, absolutely nothing, slowed up the westward march. The race to
      acquire new wealth was on! &#8220;Pike&#8217;s Peak, or Bust,&#8221; was
      the slogan! In swinging up through Nebraska the Old Trail made a wide
      rainbow circle to reach Denver. There was literally &#8220;a pot of gold&#8221;
      at the end of the rainbow! Gold, glittering yellow gold! Nothing else in
      the wide world has ever stirred men more deeply, driven them to greater
      tests of endurance, or robbed them more swiftly of reason.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Still, gold changed the whole history of the country. It
      sent a mighty migration of people across the continent, built a
      trans-continental railroad, and established an American empire on the
      Pacific coast. And gold&#8212;magic gold</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">was the life-stream of the old Overland Trail!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Cherry creek placers were the first after the
      California discoveries to attract the throngs of that gold-mad era. It was
      gold here in mid-continent! Gold in Kansas! It was new business for the
      Old Trail. The great bulk of western travel, with attending heavy
      commerce, was to the goldfields.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Again, in 1863, when placer gold was discovered in the
      Alder Gulch section of Montana, traffic on the old line became enormously
      heavy. The three principal camps&#8212;Bannock, Virginia City, and Nevada&#8212;yielded
      a hundred million dollars in placer gold. Twenty thousand gold-hungry
      miners frantically worked the streams for the yellow metal, while
      thousands more men were on the road to and from that Eldorado. They were
      mostly from the East&#8212;men who had traveled the Old Trail through
      here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Indians have been mentioned. They were notably
      troublesome at times, especially in the buffalo country west of the Blue
      river. In that territory there were four hostile tribes&#8212;Sioux,
      Cheyenne, Comanche, and Pawnee. The Indians had the Overland Stage line
      between the Blue and Julesburg blocked for six weeks in 1864.
      Station-keepers, stage-drivers, and travelers were killed; stations were
      burned and stage-stock stolen. The congestion along the line extended back
      to Atchison. Numerous itinerant outfits were detained at Granada.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Even in my time, on this side of the Blue, the sight
      of a red blanket out in the open was enough to send a spasm of fear
      surging through children, and adults did not feel any too comfortable.
      Always there was that feeling that approaching Indians in numbers might
      not be our Kickapoos, but hostiles from the other side of the Blue. Then
      there came a day when our citizens were sure of it&#8212;no mistaking that
      band of four hundred redskins for the peaceful Kickapoos!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It was a queer looking cavalcade</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">tall braves and Indians squatty, squaws fat and greasy,
      bronze maidens passably &#8220;fair&#8221;; children, papooses, ponies,
      and dogs galore</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">with
      luggage lashed on long poles hitched to ponies in buggy-shaft fashion,
      with the rear ends dragging on the ground. The Indian travois.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At four o&#8217;clock of a rather hot summer day, those
      Indians, unannounced, made camp at the old ford near the edge of town. Two
      of our influential townsmen&#8212;one professional, one artisan</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">invaded the Indian camp, and
      through speech, signs, or somehow, gleaned the information that the
      Indians were from Nebraska and were on their way to the Indian Territory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Come early bonfire-light that night, those two white
      men re-entered the Indian camp. They took along a Scotsman&#8217;s &#8220;wee
      bit&#8221; of the Indian&#8217;s &#8220;firewater,&#8221; but whether they
      unlawfully gave it to the braves or drank it themselves, was cloaked in
      silence. The charitable townspeople preferred to believe they drank it
      themselves&#8212;hence the mess. But the best &#8220;kid&#8221; analysis
      at the time favored the belief that the trouble had all come about through
      the white man&#8217;s ignorance of Indian etiquette&#8212;as with respect
      to bronze maidens passably &#8220;fair.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Those two white men were ejected from the Indian camp&#8212;not
      exactly thrown out on their ears, but definitely dismissed. Expressed in
      Indian terms, here was a tribe whose braves &#8220;no like paleface put
      nose in Indian&#8217;s business.&#8221; In the telling, those two rebuffed
      men themselves did not seem to care very much&#8212;but all through the
      night the town waited in suspense. No exaggeration, there was needless
      apprehension. And may I add that this episode did not react unfavorably
      against the future high standing of those two influentials.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Traffic on the old dirt road, known as the Overland
      Trail, began in a big way in 1859, when the powerful freighting firm of
      Russell, Majors, and Waddell acquired the stage and mail business of John
      M. Hockaday, who held the first mail contract. The road was given another
      big boost when Ben Holladay, with his famous Concord coaches and four and
      six-horse teams, came onto the line in 1861. Holladay took over the stage
      and mail business of Russell, Majors, and Waddell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">About three thousand horses and mules were in the
      stage service. Eight to twelve animals were kept at each station, which
      were spaced on an average of twelve miles apart. At its highest the stage
      fare to Denver was $125, and to Sacramento $225.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Russell, Majors, and Waddell firm, with
      headquarters at Atchison and Leavenworth, continued in the freighting
      business. This company employed 8,000 men, and was equipped with 6,000
      heavy wagons, and 75,000 oxen. At the same time there were about twenty
      other firms and individuals freighting out of Atchison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Russell firm, with other interests, established the
      Pony Express in 1860. The route from St. Joseph to Sacramento, 1920 miles,
      was covered in ten days&#8212;semi-weekly, at first. When the Civil war
      commenced, it was changed to daily. In the service were eighty riders and
      500 horses</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">not ponies of
      the Indian class, but the best blooded horses that money could buy. They
      had to be fast to outrace the hostile Indians. The Pony Express, carrying
      first-class letters and telegrams only, lasted eighteen months. Telegraph
      connection with the Far West was established then. For a half-ounce letter
      a 10-cent Government postage stamp and a dollar Pony Express stamp were
      required. The Pony Express charge was much more at first.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Riders starting from St. Joseph and Sacramento
      simultaneously every morning kept a constant stream going both ways&#8212;day
      and night. Like the stage drivers, each rider had a given territory to
      make, with a change of horses every twelve miles. The first lap was from
      St. Joseph to Seneca. Lightweight riders only were used&#8212;mere boys
      they were. Don C. Rising was a Pony Express rider. He made his home in
      Wetmore after the close of the staging days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The old road, with St. Joseph and Leavenworth as initial
      starting points, had a junction at Kennekuk, one and one-half miles south
      of the present site of Horton. On the St. Joseph branch were three
      stations</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Wathena, Troy,
      and Lewis.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Later, Atchison was made the starting point for the
      stage and mails. At this time railroad service was extended from St.
      Joseph to Atchison&#8212;and, on the west end, river service was had from
      Sacramento to San Francisco. The first station out of Atchison was
      Lancaster, 11 miles. Then Kennekuk, 24 miles; Kickapoo, 36 miles; Log
      Chain, 49 miles; Seneca, 60 miles.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">From Seneca the line continued westward to Marysville.
      It crossed the Big Blue river at Marysville, went up the Little Blue
      valley, crossed over to the Platte valley, then up the Platte to Fort
      Kearney. At Julesburg one branch turned south into Denver. The main line
      crossed the South Platte at Julesburg, touched at Fort Larimer and Fort
      Bridger in Wyoming. From Salt Lake it took a western course across Nevada
      to Virginia City; thence over the Sierra Nevada mountains to Placerville
      and Sacramento.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Considerable attention is given to the routing through
      Nemaha and Brown counties. For historical purposes, it is important that
      this should be done now while it is yet possible to trace the route with
      some degree of accuracy. Only slight evidences of the Old Trail remain.
      Practically everything obtainable now is a carry over from another
      generation, hearsay. In a few years more all information pertaining to the
      old road will have been relayed to a third and fourth generation, if not,
      indeed, forgotten altogether, locally. There are people here now, some
      living almost atop the Old Trail, who have never heard of it. There are
      none living now who were adults then, and even very few who were children.
      Albert Pitman, of Sabetha, aged 90, is probably the oldest person now
      living who was in the Powhattan-Granada neighborhood during staging days.
      Mrs. Martha Hart, E. J. Woodman, Volley Hough, Edwin Smith, and Ed.
      Vilott, now living at McAlister, Oklahoma, were children.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Tracing the Old Trail, locally, we find: The road at
      first came almost due west from Kennekuk across the Kickapoo Indian
      reservation, but probably bent over into what is now Brown County, as it
      followed the ridges. It crossed the Delaware at a point about eighty rods
      upstream from the crooked bridge on the present south line of the
      reservation&#8212;the Jackson-Brown County line. The Kickapoo reservation
      at that time contained about 150,000 acres. It has since been diminished
      three times. Now it is a block five by six miles in extent, thirty
      sections, 19,200 acres</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">with
      much of the land owned by the whites.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The first mission, built in 1856, was located on Horton
      Heights, inside the present city limits of Horton. The site was marked by
      a red glacial boulder on December 1, 1936</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">80 years after the Indian school was established by E.
      M. Hubbard&#8212;the first school of any kind in Brown County.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, there is confusion about the name of the stream
      spanned by the crooked bridge. Some call it the Grasshopper, and others
      refer to it as Walnut creek. It is neither. Lewis and Clark, explorers,
      named it the Grasshopper in 1804. It was changed to the Delaware in 1875
      by an act of the Kansas legislature.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">From that creek crossing, the trail followed the ridge
      to the old town of Powhattan in section 33, Powhattan township&#8212;the
      same section on which the East Powhattan school house is located, at the
      present intersection of U. S. 75 and the new graveled highway now running
      11 miles straight east to Horton. The change station was on the northeast
      quarter, owned by Henry Gotchell, who had charge of the station, and also
      the post office.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My mother got her first letter written by relatives in
      Tennessee, at the Powhattan post office. Her cousin, Gaius Cullom, a
      school teacher, wrote: &#8220;Powhattan&#8212;why, that&#8217;s an Indian
      name! I am grieved to believe my dear cousin Martha is residing
      dangerously close to wild Indians. Be careful, my favorite, and don&#8217;t
      let those accursed aborigines get your scalp!&#8221; Alone for the day
      with her three small children in her country home, a year later, some such
      fears must have gripped my mother, when, on approach of a meandering band
      of blanketed Kickapoos, she hurriedly gathered up her brood and made a
      dash for the cornfield.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The old town of Powhattan&#8212;not to be confused with
      the present town of Powhattan farther over in Brown county&#8212;which was
      established 11 miles northeast when the Rock Island railway went through
      in 1886</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">was in the center
      of the northwest quarter of section 33. There was a store, hotel,
      blacksmith shop, and numerous dwellings. Although regularly surveyed in
      town lots, nobody really owned the land on which the town was located at
      the time. It was held by &#8220;quatter&#8217;s rights,&#8221; in
      succession, by three men&#8212;Peter Shavey, Riley Woodman, and C. C.
      Grubb. It is now a cornfield, owned by Mrs. James Grubb.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">From Powhattan, the line ran west across the
      Timber-lake and Cassity lands. The Timberlake land is now owned by Mrs.
      Cora Jenkins. The road then followed the ridge to Granada, passing from
      Brown county to Nemaha county at that point.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In 1860 the Powhattan change station was moved to a
      point three miles north. The change was made to take out a big curve and
      save mileage. The new station was called Kickapoo. It was on Indian land
      near the new mission on the west edge of the reservation. Noble H. Rising
      was in charge. Later, he was a merchant in Wetmore; as was also W. W.
      Letson, Express messenger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Going back to the Grasshopper-Delaware crossing, the
      new line ran northwest to the mission, crossing Gregg&#8217;s creek&#8212;now
      Walnut creek&#8212;about midway. From the mission, the road crossed the
      Bill Garvin lands and went almost due west to Granada, crossing Gregg&#8217;s
      (Walnut) creek again downstream from the present bridge east of Granada.
      Joe Plankington recently found a cache of rough &#8220;diamonds&#8221; in
      a hollow at the base of a tree near this crossing. The &#8220;rocks&#8221;
      were supposedly hidden there by a returning traveler, back in the sixties&#8212;probably
      a prospector afraid to chance crossing the Kickapoo reservation, carrying
      his precious find.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">NOTE&#8212;Since this article was printed in 1936, Joe
      Plankington tells me that one of the old Kickapoos&#8212;Pas-co-nan-te,
      father of John &#8220;Butler</span> <span>&#8221;</span> <span class="c0">&#8212;told
      him the Indians were stalking the traveler and that he, Pas-co-nan-te,
      watched the wayfarer hide the rocks in that tree, many moons ago. And Joe
      said the old Indian accurately traced the way</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">on paper&#8212;tree by tree, from the Trail to the
      right tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And furthermore, Joe believes he has seen the scalp of
      the former possessor of his rocks&#8212;and at the same time had his own
      hair standing on end. Because of a slight favor by Joe, Pas-co-nan-te
      asked him if he would like to see a scalp, and at the same time told a
      young Indian whom Joe thinks was a grandson, to fetch one. When the scalp
      was laid down where Joe could get a good look at it, Pas-co-nan-te grabbed
      Joe by the &#8220;topknot&#8221; saying, &#8220;Maybe me show you how.&#8221;
      The knife the Indian held in his other hand cut Joe to the quick&#8212;but
      the blood froze in his veins, and not a drop was spilled. Then the old
      Indian said, &#8220;Me foolin.&#8217; Me know better now.&#8221; The young
      Indian told Joe, later, that he was pretty sure the old Indians had killed
      the traveler.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Joe also says he sent one of the &#8220;diamonds&#8221;
      to a niece in Boise, Idaho, and that the cutter who dressed the stone&#8212;for
      $25&#8212;pronounced it a high-quality pigeon blood ruby.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The old stage drivers &#8220;bumped&#8221; into many
      exciting and some amusing incidents. In the Far West &#8220;Hank Monk&#8221;
      held the record for fast driving and tall stories. And fictitious or not,
      &#8220;Hank&#8221; was the ranking driver in the West. Here it was Bob
      Ridley, Bill Evans, and Lon Huff&#8212;with Bob well out in front. My
      cousin, Bill Porter, says his uncle Bill Evans told this one. His run took
      him across the Kickapoo reservation. Whenever his stage would pass the
      Indian Mission the young Indians would put on a demonstration</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">race their ponies around the stage, compelling him to
      stop. Then they would ask for tobacco. Bill was always prepared for them.
      On one trip out of Saint Joseph he had only two passengers</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">mere boys, from the East. They said they were going
      West to fight Indians, and they had the guns strapped on them to do it.
      Knowing how the young Indian bucks would perform, Bill told his passengers
      that he was now coming into Indian country, and was liable to be attacked&#8212;but
      they, the boys, must not start shooting until he gave the word. It would
      be suicidal for them to start the fight. He told them other reasonable and
      some* highly unreasonable stories about the Indians. The boys were
      expecting the worst. The young Indian bucks appeared as usual, and circled
      the stage&#8212;yelling, screaming, yelling like assassins pouring out of
      bedlam. Bill tossed his plug of tobacco out to them&#8212;then climbed
      down from his high seat and looked in on the boys. They were down on the
      floor, hiding. Before completing his run, the boys told Evans that they
      were going to abandon the notion of fighting Indians. Bill said, &#8220;I
      told them that I was sure they would change their minds after having one
      good look at the Indians.&#8221; One of the boys said, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t
      really get a good look at them&#8212;.&#8221; but we heard their
      blood-curdling yells, and that was enough. The other boy said, &#8220;What
      I want to know is&#8212;how do we happen to be alive?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After the removal of the Powhattan change station,
      Henry Gotchell sold to Riley Woodman. Woodman sold to C. C. Grubb, who
      came to section 33 in 1857. Grubb was postmaster after Gotchell. Mail was
      carried down from Granada. Later, the Powhattan postoffice was moved to
      Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Riley Woodman, father of E. J. Woodman, came in 1863.
      While the mail and stage now went on the north road, some traffic still
      followed the old line. In December, 1863, an ox-train transporting
      Government supplies was snowed in at the Woodman place and remained there
      until March. In the outfit were seventeen men, two saddle horses, and
      ninety-six oxen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Government paid Woodman one dollar a- bushel for
      corn&#8212;not an excessive price, under prevailing conditions. But often
      freighters and travelers were compelled, in emergencies, to pay ruinous
      prices for feed. Scarcity and the high cost of provisions at times, also
      taxed the travelers&#8217; slender resources.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In 1860, the driest of all years in Kansas since the
      first efforts at farming, nothing was produced. Potatoes, Mrs. Martha Hart
      tells me, did not grow as large as hazelnuts. That year William Porter
      yoked up four steers to his lumber wagon and drove them over into
      Missouri, where he traded one yoke of oxen for provisions&#8212;and he
      didn&#8217;t get a burdensome return load, at that. There was a little
      short slough-grass in the lowlands, which the farmers cut with cradles and
      sold to overland travelers at twenty cents a pound.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">From Granada, the road went past the cemetery, touched
      at the Sneathen Vilott farm, section 24, Capioma township; thence
      northwest to Log Chain in section 19. From Log Chain the line ran
      northwest to old Lincoln, section 13, Mitchell township&#8212;about one
      mile northeast of the State lake&#8212;thence to Seneca. Granada and
      Lincoln were not change stations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">If the hills about old Log Chain could talk, doubtless
      one could find a lot of story material there. While to my knowledge the
      only thing to distinguish that station was the mud-hole that gave it its
      name, it really has a colorful background. Rich in legendary lore and
      historical fact, there is no telling what an enterprising artist might do
      in painting the old picture over. It is said Abe Lincoln got as far west
      as Log Chain. The land is now owned by Dr. Sam Murdock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Nearly all the old-timers here took one or more turns
      at bull-whacking across the plains. It was the only sure money &#8220;crop&#8221;
      for the pioneer farmer. Usually one trip was enough. Fred Liebig, Henry
      McCreery, and John Williams made several trips.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Fred Shumaker, father of Roy and &#8220;Hank,&#8221;
      who came here in 1856, was a driver for the freighting firm that
      transported the stores for General Johnson&#8217;s army. After the army
      had reached Fort Bridger, where it was detained through the first winter,
      Shumaker was detailed as driver for a guard sent on beyond Salt Lake to
      meet the army payroll coming in from California. The safe containing the
      money was transferred to his wagon. On that trip he saw, scattered about
      on either side of the road, bleaching in the desert sun, the bones of
      those ill-fated emigrants who lost their lives in the Meadow Mountain
      massacre. Fred Shumaker earned enough money on that trip to pay for his
      first farm, which cost him $1.25 an acre. He married Rachel Jennings, the
      sister of Zeke Jennings who lived on a farm northeast of Wetmore for many
      years. She was employed in the Perry hotel at Kennekuk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Bill and Ben Porter, who came here first in 1856&#8212;left,
      and came again in 1858, drove oxen for a transport company hauling
      Government supplies. On one trip, the company feed supplies ran short out
      in Wyoming and most of the stock died. The train was hauling corn to the
      northwest forts, but it could not be used, even in emergencies like that.
      A guard was left with the train while waiting for fresh oxen to move it.
      The weak cattle, still able to travel, were taken back to Leavenworth. It
      was a bitter cold winter. The drivers protected themselves as best they
      could from the Arctic blasts in snow drifts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Wagon trains of the larger outfits consisted of
      twenty-five wagons, five yoke of oxen and a driver for each wagon</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">with wagon-boss, assistant boss,
      and herder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My Uncle Nick Bristow and Green Campbell took a turn
      at bull-whacking for that major freighting firm&#8212;Russell, Majors, and
      Waddell. But imbued with the spirit of the times, they forsook the bulls
      for the more exciting business of panning gold. My uncle&#8217;s exploits
      have been mentioned. In other articles I have referred, with no little
      degree of pride, to the Campbell mining success&#8212;he having gone from
      here into the West in company with my uncle&#8212;and then, too, he
      &#8220;schooled&#8221; one connected with my own efforts in the mining
      game. That we failed to duplicate his enviable success was no reflection
      on that able tutor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">This, however, has never been in print. Green Campbell
      made his first money at mining in the Cherry creek diggings</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">$60,000. He spent most of it while in that camp. He
      told my mining partner, Frank Williams, that he spent his money rather too
      freely, in the customary way of that period, at old Auraria. It was money
      he very much needed later. With only $1,500 of his stake remaining, he
      went to the Alder Gulch diggings in Montana. At Bannock he and a partner,
      Mart Walsh, located claims which sold for $80,000. Walsh, a merchant at
      Muscotah in the early days, at one time owned 600 acres of land north of
      that town. He died in a county home in Oklahoma, penniless. He was a
      brother-in-law of Mrs. William Maxwell, of Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Later, Green Campbell made his big fortune, millions, in
      lode mining in Utah and Nevada, which, since his death has, largely, been
      kept intact by his wife and two sons, Allen and Byram</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">his second family</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">now living at 705 Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, California.
      The first boy was named for his father, who, in the halls of Congress, was
      the Honorable Allen G. Campbell. The other boy was named for Campbell&#8217;s
      partner in the famous Horn Silver mine&#8212;August Byram, of Atchison.
      There was a girl, Caroline.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Given space, I could make of this in itself a very
      interesting story. Green Campbell&#8217;s second wife was Eleanor Young, a
      reporter on a Salt Lake newspaper, and daughter-in-law of the famous old
      Brigham himself, who hated all peoples not of the Mormon faith. It is not
      recorded that the lady said to her man, like Ruth of old, &#8220;Thy
      people shall be my people, and thy God my God.&#8221; But the inference
      is, she did. Campbell did not go Mormon. Indeed, he was poison to the
      saints after he contested the election of his Mormon opponent, Bishop
      Cannon, and took unto himself the Canadian&#8217;s seat in Congress after
      it had been occupied by the alien for nearly two years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Several of the old stage drivers, after closing days,
      married and settled down in Wetmore. Robert Sewell married Cicily
      Locknane; Lon Huff married Clara Rising; Bill Evans married Kate Porter.
      Through their activities on the stage line, and breathing the free
      atmosphere of frontier life, these men were all moulded pretty much into a
      like pattern. Good story-tellers all, they lent themselves to the
      occupation without stint. Jovial and courteous at all times, they shunned
      work&#8212;unless it be with horses. Lon Huff drove the hearse for the
      local undertaker. He had a black team for adults, and a team of white
      horses for children.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Robert Sewell, the outstanding character, known on the
      plains as &#8220;Bob Ridley,&#8221; owned a livery stable here. Shall I
      tell the auto-minded young sprouts that the livery stable, now in the
      discard, was an enterprise of the horse-and-buggy days&#8212;a place where
      rigs were kept for hire? Sewell&#8217;s wife, Cicily, ran a hotel. Her
      mother, Mrs. D. M. Locknane, had conducted a famous eating house just west
      of Granada during overland days. Those two early-day enterprises of the
      Sewells were known as the &#8220;Overland Livery Stable,&#8221; and the
      &#8220;Overland Hotel.&#8221; Bob Sewell had a record of killing three
      Indians and wounding a dozen more in a running fight near Cottonwood
      Springs. Ben Holladay gave him a gold watch for saving the stage and four
      mules.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">About the Old Trail, I have heard my uncle say that in
      the flush times of 1865 and 1866, when traffic was at its peak, there was
      hardly an hour of the day when one could not see the road lined for miles&#8212;one
      seeming endless procession moving westward. No other road ever had such a
      promiscuous, persevering throng&#8212;a weary plodding throng, whose way
      was fraught with many hardships, whose dead were left all along the Old
      Trail from the Missouri river to the Golden Gate. Other stage lines
      threaded the West and the Southwest&#8212;but the Overland has gone down
      in history as the greatest of them all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Three score and ten years have now gone by since the
      last Concord stage coach made its final run from Atchison, through
      Granada. All equipment was at that time moved west to the end of steel&#8212;leaving
      the eastern end of the great Overland Trail abandoned and waiting, a lost
      ghost, for the day when Fate, slow but sure, should plow it under. And
      with poignant memory was gone, too, a stirring bit of frontier life in the
      West.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">The train wound its way by easy stages down from the
      mountain heights into the desert valley. The railroad split the great
      basin in halves. On either side treeless mountains rose in endless
      succession. It was mid-summer in the great inter-mountain region&#8212;and
      the sage-fringed valley, broad and almost level, stretching ahead for
      miles and miles, shimmered frightfully under the glaring rays of the
      noonday sun. And winds swept out of the south like withering blasts from a
      slag furnace.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was the Utah desert.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Far off to the right, shrouded in desert haze, could be
      seen the tip of a mountain which marked the approximate location of a
      famous early-day mining camp. The scene</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">barren, desolate, and so familiar to me</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">brought back a flood of memories. Instantly my mind
      dwelt upon events of the long-ago in that old mining camp and
      simultaneously with the home-life back in Kansas of the man who made it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In that brief flash I saw it all. In that jumbled
      picture I glimpsed a sturdy hoist over a deep shaft at the base of that
      mountain, whose cables had in times past brought up daily tons of
      high-grade argentiferous ore, every ton of which, though it greatly
      enriched my erstwhile Kansas.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">In that flash I glimpsed too a stretch of rich rolling
      Kansas prairie lined with streams of running water and a healthy growth of
      timber, in the center of which, down by the timber&#8217;s edge, was once
      this man&#8217;s place of abode, and which was then, and still is, but a
      few miles from my own home. And I saw a wrecked home; a court house
      thronged with curious people; and a lonely woman, a distraught wife and

      <span class="c2 c0">Among the emigrants from the East during the early
      settlement of the Sunflower state, were John and Green Campbell. Tall,
      stalwart young men they were. Green was then twenty-two years old. John
      was a few years older. With their sisters, Caroline and Sally Ann, and
      their mother, Ruth Campbell, born in North Carolina in 1803, they came to
      Nemaha county by ox-team in a covered wagon from down around Springfield,
      Missouri, in 1856. Their father, James Campbell, had died in Missouri.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Passing up smooth high lands, the brothers selected
      adjoining claims in the breaks of upper Elk creek, section thirty, Wetmore
      township. This selection of rather rough lands was influenced no doubt by
      the presence of some timber and a spring of &#8220;living&#8221; water&#8212;two
      indispensable requisites of the pioneer farmer. Then, too, they might have
      entertained the notion of becoming cattle barons. Many of the early comers
      had such dreams. Here was the ideal location. Here they would have few
      neighbors&#8212;and unlimited free range.</span>

    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">I want to thank you for the copies of the Wetmore

      Williams had already given me one issue, which I have loaned to several of

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Father died while I was still so young that I have
      been able to retain but few memories of him. However, I have gathered so
      many impressions from friends who knew him well, not to mention mother,
      that I feel that I have gained quite a true picture of him. In this
      connection it seems to me that your life of him is not only accurate, in
      its main for I know this to be true features, but that it goes deeper, and
      gives some of the spirit that animated him. And particularly do I like
      your last paragraph, and your reference &#8220;. . . . in whose heart
      there seems to have burned an inextinguishable desire for something that

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">Byram C. Campbell</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In that same year, 1856, Isaiah Thomas, with his
      family, came here from Newton, Iowa. He had traveled all the way from
      Indiana to Iowa, thence here, with ox-team and covered wagon. Custom and
      bovine traits had caused him to walk alongside his oxen for practically
      all those wearying miles. Isaiah Thomas settled on a quarter of land north
      of that taken up by Green Campbell. His eldest boy, Elwood, was a lad of
      fifteen years, seven years younger than Green Campbell. The destinies of
      these two young men were to be subsequently linked together in gigantic
      enterprises in a still newer frontier environment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Times were close for the Campbells. They were
      compelled, as were many early Kansas settlers, to pick up here and there a
      few extra dollars, as opportunity offered, while becoming established on
      the farm. Green Campbell found employment with the freighting firm of
      Russell, Majors, and Waddell, at Leavenworth. His work took him often into
      the West. When the Cherry creek gold excitement on the east slope of the
      Rocky mountains broke out in 1858, he joined the throngs in that mad rush.
      He cleaned up $60,000 from the placer mines, but had spent most of it
      before coming back to his homestead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then for a while Green worked his land while the boy
      Elwood grew up. Elwood was not to come into the picture, the gigantic
      doings, for some years yet. In the meantime his father, Isaiah Thomas, had
      gone to the war and had died in Arkansas. His mother, Martha Thomas, with
      her family of seven children, had moved over to the north part of the
      township and settled on forty acres a quarter mile east of Wetmore, which
      place has been, until a few months ago, the home of her son, Manning.
      Unmarried, and the last of that pioneer family, he died May 12, 1938.
      Though very young, Elwood Thomas also joined the Union ranks and was held
      prisoner of war at Tyler, Texas, for nearly a year. Shortly after
      returning from the war, he married Maria Adamson, of Holton. They had four
      children&#8212;three girls and a boy. Charley, the son, died at Beatty,
      Nevada, in August last year.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Five years after his first mining venture, in 1863,
      Green Campbell was again panning gold at Bannock, Montana. His take this
      time was $40,000. Then, after one more desultory try on the farm, he
      married Florence Oursler, of Circleville, in 1867. She was the daughter of
      Rufus Oursler, wealthy resident of Jackson County. She was a beautiful
      woman.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">For a few years contentment reigned in the Campbell
      home. I remember going with my Uncle Nick Bristow one time when he visited
      in that home. We went in a covered wagon, a wagon that was little more
      than a ghost of the old &#8220;prairie schooner,&#8221; having all five of
      the bows still in place, with a tattered canvas over only the rear half.
      But my uncle walked all the way alongside his nigh ox. Uncle had a &#8220;log-wagon&#8221;
      for heavy hauling on the farm. He kept this one for special occasions and
      Sunday driving. He owned no horses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Uncle Nick and Green Campbell had mined together in
      the Cherry creek diggings&#8212;and the fact that his host of the day had
      cleaned up big, while he himself brought home only alibis, and a cougar
      pelt, had not impaired a fine friendship. Conscious of Mr. Campbell&#8217;s
      mine-made money, it then seemed to me, a youngster, that the Campbells had
      everything&#8212;even a &#8220;hired&#8221; girl. That girl was Elizabeth
      Dittman, now Mrs. Ed. Keggin, living in Wetmore, who would tell you that
      everything was fine and lovely with them then, as it had every reason to
      be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then rumor of a new mining strike in the West changed
      everything. Green Campbell now found life irksome on his then none too
      productive acres down on the banks of Elk creek. And as he turned over the
      soil with his plow on a bright May day in 1871, he also turned things over
      in his mind. His brother John, he decided, could remain on the farm and
      keep up the fight against odds if he wanted to, but as for himself the Far
      West was calling. That call had struck the man of my story with all the
      force of a Kansas tornado, and it moved him from his anchorage on the farm
      with a suddenness that brought a protest from his relatives.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">So it was that Green Campbell, with his family now
      shifted to Circleville, the home of his in-laws, went out again in quest
      of a third fortune. And though millions came into his coffers, one cannot
      be sure, after all these years and in the light of what followed, whether
      he profited or lost by that abrupt decision back here on that bright May
      morning sixty and seven years ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">They called him a tenderfoot when he reached the end
      of the trail which led out into a sand-blown waste two hundred miles and
      more beyond rail transportation. Here, on the east slope of the San
      Francisco mountains, in southwest Utah&#8212;about thirty miles from
      Milford, on the San Pedro line&#8212;this man from the plains country,
      ripe for more adventure, was to have a try for a third mining fortune. It
      was his first hard-rock mining venture.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Green Campbell got the gold all right&#8212;millions of
      it</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and distinguished
      himself by developing one of the greatest silver mines of the age. But
      that is only part of the story.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The great fortune was won by so close a margin that it
      hurt. Then there was, to some extent, the usual anti-climax</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">spiced with complicated domestic relations, growing
      out of an improvident situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the name &#8220;tenderfoot,&#8221; as applied to
      Green Campbell, was not quite right. He had already taken $100,000 from
      the placers; certainly enough to lift him out of that classification. Even
      so, granting that he was a seasoned miner at the time he entered the Utah
      field, Green Campbell did, however, slip just a trifle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The erroneous application of that appellation came
      about through a little misjudgment of the waters of that desert country&#8212;springs
      they are called. But the springs in that section, as in all other desert
      country, with few exceptions, are not the bubbling, sparkling, steady flow
      of waters generally visualized with the mention of springs. Rather, in
      most instances, they are only seepages of water which must be collected in
      ground reservoirs through a system of trenching the earth. Some of those
      springs supply what is termed on the desert as sweet water, while other
      springs&#8212;those issuing from volcanic rocks&#8212;are brackish and
      unfit for domestic use, or for steaming purposes. The first spring
      developed by Green Campbell was of the latter class.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Thus it was that when in later years Green Campbell
      went over into Nevada to establish a new camp, he first had the waters
      analyzed by a chemist, then very appropriately named his new camp
      Goodsprings. And it so remains on the map today&#8212;a gold,
      silver-lead-zinc, and vanadium mining camp down among the gentle slopes of
      the Spring mountain range in southern Nevada. The next two camps
      established by Green Campbell, in California, were named Vanderbilt and
      Providence. We may be sure the water there was good also.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Here, I want to interrupt my story to say that it was
      at Goodsprings where the writer was, some thirty-odd years ago, initiated
      into the mining game along with Campbell followers, and where much of the
      material for this narrative was picked up, first-hand. Here at Goodsprings
      were Elwood Thomas and his nephew, Frank Williams. Elwood Thomas had been
      Green Campbell&#8217;s right-hand man all through the latter&#8217;s
      colorful mining career, having gone out from the old home town in Kansas
      to join him in 1873. Frank Williams went direct from Wetmore to Mr.
      Campbell, at the age of twenty-one, and has spent forty-seven of his
      sixty-eight years on the Nevada desert. And perhaps I should say here that
      much of the information presented in this narrative was obtained from Mr.
      Thomas and Mr. Williams.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the Utah field, then a new and isolated country,
      under conditions that tested the fiber of the man, Green Campbell
      prospected the hills of Beaver county for a while. Then, nearly five years
      later, his big opportunity came when he secured an option on a mining
      claim for which he agreed to pay $25,000. That claim was later developed
      into the famous Horn Silver mine, which, up to the time of my last visit
      nearly thirty years ago, had produced slightly in excess of twenty million
      dollars. The mine, owned now by New York interests, is still producing at
      great depth. Few metal mines there are that have had such long run of
      life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But, as I have already stated, chance played a big
      hand in this game of millions. At that time Green Campbell had all his
      funds tied up in other properties. He was then operating the Hickory mine
      at Newhouse. Green Campbell turned to his friend, August Byram, of
      Atchison, Kansas, for financial assistance. Byram and Campbell had become
      acquainted while they were both in the employ of that major freighting
      firm. Byram had already spent some money at the suggestion of Campbell
      without results, in the Star district, close by. After considerable
      correspondence, Byram decided to take another chance at the game,
      promising to come through with the funds to take over the Horn Silver
      claim before the expiration of the ninety-day option. Byram was to advance
      the full amount, half of it as a loan to Campbell, and they were to own
      the property on a fifty-fifty basis.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But here caution stepped in and robbed those two men
      of exactly one-half of an immense fortune&#8212;a fortune in the making.
      After the agreement had been made Byram wrote and asked Campbell to see if
      he could find someone to take a quarter interest in the risk. Campbell
      found two men, Matt Cullen and Dennis Ryan, who would come in for a
      quarter interest. But Byram still thought he was taking too great a
      chance, and wrote a second time asking Campbell to try induce those two
      men to take a half interest. It was so arranged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Green Campbell then settled down to a game of waiting.
      Thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the times, he told himself&#8212;and
      rightly, too&#8212;that he had only to await the coming of Byram to jump
      in and win. But, without further word from Byram and the final day of the
      option drawing near, he became very nervous. New developments had caused
      the owners to look for some chance to void the option, and Campbell sensed
      danger in delay. Then came the awful blow that set all his emotions to
      working at high speed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">August Byram, on his way out to the mine, had stopped
      over in Salt Lake City and there he was discouraged by designing
      individuals who wanted to pluck the mine for themselves. Developments had
      increased, its value fourfold. But this fact was kept from Byram by his
      Salt Lake acquaintances&#8212;indeed, they stressed the fact that the
      claim had but recently been optioned for $1,500, and that the option had
      been allowed to lapse. The result was August sent word to Green that he
      would have nothing more to do with it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, Campbell managed somehow to get Byram over to
      the property on the last day of the option, but up to the eleventh hour he
      was filled to the brim with nerve-wracking suspense. For hours he had kept
      his gaze constantly fixed on the sage-fringed road leading out across the
      broad valley to the east, where was open to the eye a twenty mile sweep of
      sun-baked waste, looking for that distant dust cloud which might mean that
      relief for his tired nerves was on the way. Then, late in the afternoon,
      as the last golden tints lingered along the ragged edges of the mountains,
      the stage bearing Byram, full four hours late, was sighted far out on the
      road&#8212;a mere speck in a great cloud of dust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was yet time for speedy action. For a brief ten
      minutes the two men faced each other&#8212;Campbell full of words, Byram
      deep in meditation. It could hardly be expected that after floundering in
      a bog of indecision and doubt for so long, that understanding would come
      to Byram in a flash. But Campbell&#8217;s great anxiety in the matter
      caused him to believe, for the moment, that Byram&#8217;s resolutions were
      still wavering, while his own thoughts whirled like leaves in an autumn
      blast. Byram&#8217;s final words, however, kept Campbell&#8217;s spirits
      from suffering further.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I was not there at that particular time, of course,
      but this minute accounting, the reactions of those men, is as I caught it
      from Elwood Thomas. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been such a serious matter
      with Green,&#8221; said Elwood, amid chuckles that sent ripples all over
      the old miner&#8217;s weathered face, &#8220;it would have been downright
      amusing.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The transfer of the Horn Silver claim took place in
      the shadow of the mountain as the sun dropped out of sight on February 17,
      1876. And it was a joyous occasion for the little group of interested men&#8212;except,
      possibly, the two original locators who were now beginning to realize the
      true worth of that little piece of ground. Fate dealt a mean hand to the
      locators of the Horn Silver claim. After sinking a shaft thirty feet on
      ore, Samuel Hawkes and James Ryan bartered away millions on the belief
      that the ore would not last.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And I might say here that the Horn Silver lode, the
      main ore body, was found by sheer accident. Jimmy Calvering, a young
      Irishman employed to do the location work, following the custom of the
      shiftless miner, went away a considerable distance from the outcrop to
      find &#8220;soft ground&#8221; in which to dig his ten-foot hole, as
      required by law. Jimmy was not looking for ore, but in doing that ten foot
      of work he opened up the main lode. And nowhere else did it come that near
      the surface. Jimmy was ever after that proclaimed &#8220;A man with a
      great nose for ore.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Horn Silver mine was operated by Campbell, Cullen
      &amp; Co., for three years, with a gross production of nearly three
      million dollars. The mine was then sold in 1879 for six million dollars,
      and title passed to the Horn Silver Mining Co. An interest equivalent to
      about one-sixth of the mine previously had been given to an eastern
      promoter for securing a railroad to the mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Green Campbell had other interests at Frisco, the camp
      which had sprung up about the Horn Silver mine. It was a town peopled with
      all kinds of characters known to frontier life. It had all the mining-camp
      trappings&#8212;dance halls, saloons, and what not. This camp had caught
      the overflow from the older mining camp of Pioche, in Nevada, where the
      boast was, &#8220;A man for breakfast every morning!&#8221; And in
      lawlessness Frisco flourished like the green bay tree! Life at the high
      tide was almost as cheap as water! But Green Campbell&#8217;s personality
      was such as to keep him out of harm&#8217;s way. Green was a good mixer.
      He drank some, but in moderation. In no sense was he a dissipated man. And
      here at Frisco he made more money! Lots of it! The Carbonate mine alone
      gave him five hundred thousand dollars in profits! He was classed with
      other mining moguls of that day. Hearst, Tabor, Walsh&#8212;he knew them
      all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Green Campbell&#8217;s rise in the financial world was
      spectacular. Within the brief span of a few years he could have returned
      to his old home and to his family with enough money to live in luxury. But
      friend Green had other notions. Like the noble beast of burden of the
      Sahara bearing his name, Campbell was now a permanent fixture of the
      desert.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span>Man&#8217;s ambition is seldom satisfied. Visions of greater wealth
      and the thrills that go with the making held Green Campbell with a
      vise-like grip. He willed to stay in the West.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">His wife preferred to stay in Kansas with her people,
      at Circleville. Or, maybe, it was decided that the untamed West, the
      desert with its sizzling summer suns and unbridled winds, was no place for
      Florence Oursler Campbell and her little boy Charley. Anyhow the situation
      brought about an estrangement and, finally, a separation. Ofttimes men,
      too much absorbed in chasing the pot of gold, unconsciously make this
      supreme sacrifice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Clouds began to appear on Green Campbell&#8217;s
      marital horizon soon after he went West, but the storm did not break until
      he was virtually in the big money. He was enormously engrossed with his
      mining operations, while back here at home, because of his continued
      absence, a growing resentment was piling up against him day by day. The
      time was coming, if he would see it, when he must give up either his
      mines, or his family. He heeded not the signals, seriously. Like his royal
      highness across the Atlantic&#8212;the self-deposed king&#8212;until
      disaster was upon him, he proposed to keep them both.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Florence Campbell filed her petition for divorce and
      alimony in the Jackson County court at Holton. Case Broderick of Holton
      and Judge Stillings of Leavenworth were her attorneys. Green Campbell was
      represented by Hayden &amp; Hayden of Holton and Colonel Everest of
      Atchison. The stage was set for a spirited legal battle. The whole country
      buzzed with gossip. Because of the prominence of the Campbells and the
      Ourslers people traveled for miles on horseback and in wagons to attend
      the hearings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The plaintiff and her witnesses occupied the stage for a
      day and a half. Then the defense attorneys armed with depositions and a
      liberal line-up of witnesses, told the court what they had up their
      sleeves. But the judge, being somewhat of a sleuth, had already detected
      that something was wrong with the plaintiff&#8217;s legal machinery. Gears
      didn&#8217;t mesh. The charge was out of alignment with the facts as
      adduced by the plaintiff and her own witnesses. In short, her lawyers had
      experienced embarrassment in their endeavor to twist a prolonged absence
      from Campbell&#8217;s fireside</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">and whatever else that was offered&#8212;into &#8220;extreme
      cruelty.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There had to be a &#8220;charge,&#8221; to be sure,
      but it would appear that the plaintiff&#8217;s attorneys might have more
      profitably selected for their client, out of their cabinet of ready-made
      complaints, something more reasonable, something less galling to the fine
      sensibilities of the man. Judge John T. Morton said that inasmuch as the
      plaintiff had failed to prove her case, defense testimony would not be
      heard. Moreover, he said Mrs. Campbell would get no alimony.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was not, as one might suspect, another man in
      the case&#8212;not a breath of scandal. Mrs. Campbell was too fine for
      that. It was her unalterable conviction that she and her child were being
      unduly neglected. It was &#8220;blue&#8221; blood in revolt&#8212;indignant,
      regrettable rebellion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The decree was given the defendant, Green Campbell, on
      February 23, 1878. Custody of the little boy, Charles R. Campbell, was
      given to the mother. Mr. Campbell was required to pay $250 a year for the
      boy&#8217;s &#8220;keep and education,&#8221; with a lien on the northeast
      quarter of 22-6-14. Two hundred and fifty dollars a year from a potential
      millionaire to keep and educate his son! All right then, perhaps, but it
      sounds like parsimony now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Henry C. DeForest, pioneer merchant of Wetmore, was
      made custodian of the impounded land. He also acted as agent for Mrs.
      Campbell. The allowance for the boy was not held down strictly to the
      court order. Indeed, Mr. Campbell did much more for his son. It is alleged
      that, after the separation, the boy would meet the train on occasions of
      his father&#8217;s infrequent trips in from the West, and that Mr.
      Campbell would fill his son&#8217;s hat with gold coins. And in time
      Charley was given the impounded land, together with several other valuable
      tracts of Jackson County land. Green Campbell still kept his Nemaha County
      homestead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">No property settlement appears of record&#8212;leastwise
      my investigator does not report any&#8212;though, I believe, there was a
      private settlement. Little enough it was, no doubt, if any, but the
      disillusioned Mr. Campbell was not niggardly with his money, as the
      plaintiff and her kin backers, and all who listened in on the trial were
      soon to know.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As if in preparation to carry out the educational
      phase of the court mandate handsomely, Green Campbell endowed a college
      right in the boy&#8217;s door-yard, so to speak. Work began on Campbell
      University at Holton in 1880, and the school opened on September 2, 1882,
      with Prof. J. H. Miller, president. For a small-town school it became
      quite noted. After a successful run of nearly a score of years, it fell
      into decay and finally ceased to exist. The old stone building standing on
      an eminence at the northwest corner of Holton, long in disuse as a
      college, was razed in 1931 to make room for a new $139,000 brick high
      school building.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It would be interesting in this connection to know
      what Green Campbell&#8217;s reactions really were, what motivated that
      splendid school? With a knowing smile on his weathered face and without
      amplifying his surprising assertion, Elwood Thomas once told me that had
      there been no divorce there would have been no Campbell University. And
      did the boy Charley actually &#8220;finish off&#8221; at Campbell
      University? I think not. A recent casual inquiry at Circleville told me
      nothing in that particular. While yet quite young, he married Kate
      McColough. He went West&#8212;and, backed by his father, tried his hand at
      mining at Providence, California, with little or no success.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With his marital differences adjusted in the divorce
      court, Green Campbell now, like as not, a morose misogynist, went back to
      his beloved golden West and in the immediate years which followed was as
      grim and silent, on one very ticklish subject, as the barren peaks of the
      mountains about him. In his mine, Mr. Campbell had encountered and
      conquered some extremely refractory ore. He had hauled in cord-wood from
      as far as sixty miles to roast that stubborn ore in outdoor fires, to make
      it amenable to the smelter. But in marriage, a bit of clay&#8212;he had no
      workable method for that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Green Campbell came back to his old home only a few times
      after the separation. But Kansas still claimed him</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">claimed him until he went to Congress for Utah,
      claimed him until he sold his homestead here to Bill Hayden. He was Nemaha
      County&#8217;s first millionaire!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Green Campbell, first of all, was a miner. Close
      attention to business, as has been pointed out, brought him great riches&#8212;and
      a dilemma! The memory of this last named acquisition persisted,
      ghost-like, to haunt him for long years. But it did not haunt him for all
      time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the mining game, a hope never fades that another
      doesn&#8217;t bloom brightly in its place. Likewise, generally speaking,
      it is so in matters of the heart, only the flowering is not always so
      spontaneous. Sometimes, not infrequently, after the romantic love of other
      days has passed, the withering love-instinct must be carefully cultivated
      for years if it is to flower again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Fourteen years and fourteen hundred miles lay between
      Green Campbell and the subject of his marital woes when at the age of
      sixty or thereabout, after he had reached the peak of his financial flight
      and experienced some setbacks, and after he had grown a fine flowing
      snow-white beard and become quite bald, it bloomed for him again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This time the bride was Eleanor Young, a reporter on a
      Salt Lake City newspaper. She was a daughter-in-law of the famous old
      Brigham Young. And the stork, that industrious old bird of world-wide
      habitat, at home on the desert as in the oasis, brought the Campbell&#8217;s
      three fine children&#8212;Allen, Byram and Caroline.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Green Campbell would, of course, want to do something
      to perpetuate the school that bore his name. But in his will he made the
      fatal mistake&#8212;fatal for the school&#8212;of first taking care of his
      family with the more tangible assets. He bequeathed $100,000 to Campbell
      University, conditionally, however. It was to be paid out of the proceeds
      of two mining properties, namely, his Vanderbilt and Goodsprings holdings.
      A minimum price of $500,000 was placed on his Vanderbilt mine, and
      $200,000 on his Goodsprings claims, and they were not to be offered for
      less than the stipulated price for two years. The properties have not yet
      been sold. While really promising properties, with the future pledged,
      largely, by the terms of the will, there was no one to continue
      developments to make them bring the price. Green Campbell had expended
      something like a half million dollars in developing his gold mine at
      Vanderbilt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Secure in the fortune left them, the Campbell heirs</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Green&#8217;s second family&#8212;have
      risked no money in mining. Besides his various mining interests Green
      Campbell owned, at death, a magnificent home on Brockton Square, in
      Riverside, California; numerous tracts of California ranch lands, and
      real-estate holdings in downtown Los Angeles. Also, a substantial cash
      operating fund, and some income property in Salt Lake City&#8212;notably,
      the Dooley block. Mr. Campbell often expressed his faith in the future of
      Los Angeles. The fortune has largely been kept intact.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When last contacted a few years back, Mrs. Campbell
      was living at 705 Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, California. The two
      unmarried sons lived at the same address. Caroline, the daughter, was
      married to a Los Angeles banker, Leland T. Reeder, a son of the fiery and
      famous Congressman W. A. Reeder, from the sixth Kansas district, back in
      the nineties.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Idle mining properties, or mines worked only
      spasmodically by lessees, do not readily attract buyers, especially when
      filled with water, as in the case of the Campbell mine at Vanderbilt.
      Incredible as it may seem, there really is water deep down&#8212;in places&#8212;in
      that desert country, and it even rises sometimes. The shaft at our own
      mine, in the very heart of the desert, situated in a small depression on
      the mountain side, was once filled to overflowing during a heavy rain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Other bequests, principally to relatives, also were
      contingent upon the sale of those two properties. And hope, tenacious
      hope, once bloomed so very brightly but now devoid of sparkle, still
      lingers with heirs around here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Henry Campbell, a nephew, who was sheriff of Nemaha
      County for two terms about the turn of the century, with his two sisters,
      Mary and Frances, the son and daughters of John Campbell, all deceased
      now, were named jointly for $100,000. The surviving heirs are: Emma Swarm
      Campbell, wife of Henry, Bancroft, and two sons by a former marriage,
      living in the West; George Cordon, husband of Mary, Ontario; Ray Drake,
      son of Frances, Norton.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The heirs of Caroline Campbell, who married a Mr.
      Steele and went West, and the heirs of Sally Ann Campbell, who married
      Henry Stanley and lived near Circleville, were named jointly in the will
      for $100,000. William and Edward Stanley and Laura Hart, all dead now,
      were children of Sally Ann. William worked with his uncle in the mines and
      was named for an extra $100,000.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Two daughters of Green Stanley, another son of Sally Ann,
      are married to &#8220;Jack&#8221; and &#8220;Kid&#8221; Rudy, and live at
      Soldier. A daughter of Sally Ann&#8212;Julia Alice Stanley</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">married Albert D. Chamberlin, now living in Holton.
      Mrs. Chamberlin is dead. Her heirs are: Mrs. Lee Able, Holton; Mrs. S. B.
      Moody, Centralia; Mrs. Ernest Hogg, Payette, Idaho; Mrs. Mary Gaston and
      Nathaniel Chamberlin, Whitehall, Montana; and Charles Chamberlin, Salt
      Lake City.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One small payment was received by the heirs here about
      two years back, which revived interest in about the same degree of
      satisfaction as that of a sprinkle of rain to a thirsty earth. Time was,
      though, George Cordon tells me, when they could have accepted settlement
      at fifty cents on the dollar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is probable that the inheritance of Charley
      Campbell was tied up in this or by some other uncertain condition.
      Whatever the case, he settled with the estate for $50,000. Crediting rumor
      afloat at the time, it is my recollection that, in recognition of close&#8212;and
      perhaps menacing&#8212;kinship, this was paid with money left by Green
      Campbell to his second family.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Leaving an ex-wife and two sons, Allen and Robert, in
      the West, Charley Campbell later returned to Circleville. There, in 1920,
      he married Laura Deck. He is now living in or near Philadelphia.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">His mother, Florence Campbell, did not marry again.
      She went to work. And by the irony of Fate she became a teacher of art in
      the college founded by her divorced husband, along about 1895. Later,
      years later, when I saw her last she seemed merely to be waiting, in
      emptiness and dead memories, for the end. She died in Pomona, California,
      about 1920.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Elwood Thomas was administrator for the Campbell
      estate&#8212;in Nevada. After spending thirty-eight years on the desert
      and in the mines, without receiving so much as a damaging scratch, Elwood
      was fatally injured in a horse and buggy accident while back Here on a
      visit to his daughter, Mrs. Maude Ralston, at Holton, in 1915. He died
      three days after the accident. He was buried in the Wetmore cemetery.
      Elwood Thomas lived apart from his family from the time he he went West in
      1873. Family ties, it seems, were not strong enough to bridge the distance
      between them. Maybe it was the desert again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Turning momentarily aside from the path that leads
      toward the rainbow&#8217;s elusive end, let me here interpose a brief
      paragraph about John Campbell, the brother whom Green had said could
      remain on the farm and keep up the fight against odds if he wanted to.
      John did remain on the farm; and kept up the fight&#8212;and won. He even
      elected to remain on the farm after pressing invitations to join his
      brother in the land of gold. He lived on the original homestead in Wetmore
      township until he died, in 1894. As the years became more seasonable for
      the production of grain, John Campbell made a good living&#8212;and more&#8212;from
      his acres and his herds. And, best of all, he found contentment and
      happiness with his wife and three children on the farm. I think that in
      all my life I have never known a more kindly, considerate, and contented
      person than was this tall, slim, fine man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Luck was a bit fickle with Green Campbell. It both smiled
      and frowned on him in a few fleeting years. Alert, with a keen mind, he
      made good at first on everything he touched</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">save, of course, that first water-hole. Then,
      abruptly, as if a great cloud had obscured his vision, he lost his charm.
      Two outstanding reverses followed in quick succession.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Irreparable damage is often done in the name of
      friendship. With millions of dollars to the good, Green Campbell was
      picked by his friends to turn the tide of politics in Utah, to break
      Mormon rule. He was on the minority side, to be sure, but what did that
      matter? Clean and ambitious, with bulging pockets, he would be a
      formidable figure in bringing about the change so much desired&#8212;by
      the outs of course.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Thus, Green Campbell was launched upon the perilous
      sea of politics&#8212;literally shoved off into its unfriendly waters,
      slightly, but assuredly, beyond his depths. The warm and manifest
      enthusiasm of his friends, so goes the story, inspired in him a feeling of
      confidence&#8212;and, unschooled in the hard-played game of politics, he
      set sail upon the turbid political waters with never a thought as to the
      many, many wrecked political ships that mark the shores of Time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Infectious enthusiasm had spread over the field.
      Voters and non-voters alike cheered for him. The Italian colony piped,
      &#8220;Viva Campbell&#8212;bigga man!&#8221; John Chinaman, it was
      related, yelled in badly Americanized Cantonese, &#8220;Hoola Campbell!
      All-o-same-e, no like-e dlam Mormon lenny-way!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Deliverance, it seemed, was at hand. Still in the
      first flush of his great financial triumph, Green Campbell spent money
      freely for the cause, and incidentally tried for a seat in Congress. This
      experience cost him a lot of money&#8212;just how much no one knows. Some
      said it was nearly a million dollars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Green Capbell was defeated for delegate to Congress by
      the Mormon bishop, Cannon. But he contested the election upon the grounds
      that Cannon, a Canadian, was not naturalized. In this he won, but not
      until the two-year term was almost over. He went to Washington as the Hon.
      Allen G. Campbell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I shall not attempt to tell you his politics, because
      I don&#8217;t know&#8212;for sure. But when I tell you his fine saddle
      horse was named Cleveland, you can make your own deductions. It was a
      common sight to see Green Campbell mounted on that spirited horse riding
      about the streets of Vanderbilt, often with one of his little boys up in
      front of him or riding behind, while his luxuriant white beard, always
      well groomed, billowed gracefully in the desert breezes. Green Campbell
      was a large man, about six feet tall and rather portly, though not really
      fat. He always presented a prosperous, dignified appearance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now, while a million dollars, or whatever sum it
      really was, out of one pocket was a lot of money wasted in priming the
      political pump, it wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad for Green Campbell,
      seeing that he had obliged his friends, had there not been other heavy and
      unexpected drains upon his purse. It was a partnership with Jay Cooke and
      Company, a Washington stock brokerage firm, at a most unfortunate time,
      that really hurt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jay Cooke was perhaps the foremost broker of that day.
      Hard luck bankrupted him. His brokerage houses in three eastern cities
      collapsed in 1873, causing one of the greatest financial panics of all
      time. He was financing the building of the Northern Pacific railroad and
      had made too many advances. But Jay Cooke was still the promoter
      par-excellence. He was the promoter previously mentioned as having
      received an interest in the Horn Silver mine for securing a railroad to
      the camp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jay Cooke was heavily involved when Green Campbell
      became a member of the firm, and through an oversight a protecting clause
      was omitted. With new money in the firm, Cooke&#8217;s old creditors
      forced their demands. Green Campbell&#8217;s first check was drawn for
      nine hundred thousand dollars! And that was by no means the end of
      enforced payments. However, much of this loss was salvaged through
      securities turned over to Campbell by Cooke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was not at all strange that at some time in his
      financial career, after climbing up to the heights, that Green Campbell
      should take his turn on the toboggan. Nobody ever wins every step in life.
      But these two reverses, falling so swiftly and so heavily as to make them
      the high points of the drama, cut a jagged gash in the fabric of his
      dreams. And while the hand of Fate continued, for a time at least, to
      carry the Campbell fortune steadily downward, he did not lose all. Far
      from it! There was no time after selling the Horn Silver mine that he was
      not a rich man!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the winds of adversity, mighty dream-wrecking
      gales though they were, had not swept away the flame of hope. Back to his
      mines, unflagging in his efforts to do it all over again, Green Campbell
      was full of plans for the future when he died rather suddenly of
      pneumonia, in 1902. Thus, the call of the desert, the lure of the mining
      game, held him until the last.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And this is the true story of Green Campbell&#8212;gentleman,
      miner, and great wealth-builder, in whose heart there seems to have burned
      an inextinguishable desire for something that never came.</span>

      <span class="c0">There were not conveyances enough to handle the influx of
      gold-seekers when I got off the train at Nipton, California, and a long
      walk across a dry sun baked waste lay ahead of me. I was on my way to the
      new mining camp of Crescent, just over the line in Nevada, and on my way
      to a fortune&#8212;maybe. Rainbow visions began to rise before me, and hot
      though it was I did not mind that six-mile walk one bit. I was not alone.
      She was young, slender</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      pretty. And Elsie was a &#8220;gold-digger&#8221; too. There were others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With Frank Williams, a former Wetmore boy, as partner,
      I was in from the start at the &#8220;hell-roaring&#8221; mining camp back
      in 1907. Born overnight, it was a stampede mining camp, growing from
      nothing to a tented city of one thousand people in a few weeks time&#8212;followed
      quickly with saloons, dance-halls, and whatnots.</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Crescent was wild, mad, wide open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When the big news broke, I beat it for Nevada. Frank
      and I and associates owned three claims in the very heart of the Crescent
      district. Also, I personally owned an adjoining claim on which Frank had
      caused one of his men, Paul Stahmer, to do the required ten feet of work
      to hold it for one year, at a cost to me of $100. The work was done on a
      $544 gold showing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Having operated with Frank rather disappointedly in
      the lead-zinc-vanadium camp of Goodsprings, thirty miles away, through the
      years since 1904, I believed that here at last&#8212;at Crescent&#8212;I
      was about to pounce, in one fell swoop upon the legendary pot of gold. It
      was a fantastic notion, of course&#8212;but oh, the magic thrill of it!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charles M. Schwab, Pennsylvania multi-millionaire
      steel magnate, who held mining interests in Nevada, lent encouragement
      with an on-the-spot pronouncement: &#8220;In the past the great fortunes
      have been made in manufacturing, but henceforth the really big money will
      be made in mining.&#8221; Also, operators from Goldfield, the Nevada camp
      that gave George Wingfield, a lowly cowhand, twenty million dollars almost
      in a jiffy&#8212;men in the big money up there said in my presence,
      &#8220;If we had such surface showings at Goldfield as you have at
      Crescent, any old claim would sell for a fortune.&#8221; I don&#8217;t
      mind telling you that I had fed rather too optimistically upon the
      glorious prospect of grabbing a quick fortune at Crescent. But the
      unveiling of facts there proved a solvent for the nightmare in which a lot
      of us had been living for months.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">With fabulously rich surface showings</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">high assays, $500 to $20,000 to the ton reported almost
      everywhere</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">Crescent
      proved, in the end, the greatest bubble of them all. Countless thousands
      of dollars were expended, over a period of two years, in a frantic effort
      to bring out a profitable producer. But if there ever was as much as a
      shirt-tail full of ore shipped from that camp, I don&#8217;t know it. And
      though I never had the time nor the inclination to compare notes, I&#8217;ll
      bet Elsie had better pickings than any of the hopeful miners who wore
      pants.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It was with reluctance that we pulled out of Crescent. It&#8217;s
      most fascinating, this thing of prospecting for gold</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">like participating in a big-game hunt. Were I
      full-handed, even now, I would go back to Crescent and give our
      Shreve-port group another try. Someday, somebody is going to find the
      &#8220;mother lode&#8221; there.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was honest effort&#8212;a lot of honest effort&#8212;as
      well as the usual faking, at Crescent. A $20,000 gold strike was reported
      near the summit, between our claims and Crescent. The first day out there,
      I was all for seeing this strike right away. My partner said, &#8220;Oh,
      wait until tomorrow&#8212;we&#8217;ll be going past it when we go over to
      Crescent.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The next day, starting from our claims by way of a
      perfectly good wagon road down the canyon a ways, Frank took me by a
      tortuous climb, off the road, to near the top of the mountain. He pointed
      out the spot where the assay had been obtained. When I began to examine
      the shallow trench, he said, quickly, &#8220;It took all the ore in sight
      to make the assay.&#8221; Twenty steps farther on we reached the summit
      where we could look down on Crescent a mile below. And then we stepped out
      onto a very good wagon road. On inquiry, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the
      same road we left back there in the canyon.&#8221; I asked him how come we
      made that rough climb? Frank said, &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s about as
      much as a man&#8217;s life is worth to be caught showing up that strike to
      a tenderfoot.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This was an eye-opener&#8212;the first clear signpost
      on a long and uncertain road.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At another time, later, Frank and I paid a saloon
      keeper in Nipton, the railroad station, twenty dollars to drive us over
      the Crescent district, for the full day. We visited our claims first, got
      dinner in Crescent&#8212;then to a saloon where drinks were 50 cents each,
      whether whiskey, beer, or water. The bartender simply counted noses or
      glasses, as it were, and summed up the charge. There were about twenty
      saloons in the camp, and our &#8220;host&#8221; deemed it his duty to
      visit them all. I am sure he dumped the $10 I paid him on twenty glasses
      of water for me. It was a spot where you couldn&#8217;t afford to shake
      your head and say, &#8220;No thanks.&#8221; When asked to drink, it was
      wise to call your drink.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The main object of the drive&#8212;on my part, anyway</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">the thing we had paid twenty
      dollars for, was to visit a highly newspaper publicized mine two miles
      south of Crescent, where it was shamefully claimed immense bodies of rich
      gold ore running into the millions, were blocked out. But the desert
      twilight caught us still drinking Adam&#8217;s ale and the Indian&#8217;s
      &#8220;fire water.&#8221; Our driver knew his business all right&#8212;and
      I suspect Frank knew from the start that we would never fetch up at that
      mine. Nothing, absolutely nothing&#8212;but the truth&#8212;was barred in
      that camp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I shall now leave the desert momentarily, and write
      candidly about my earlier &#8220;mining&#8221; experience. This, and other
      notations here&#8212;until we get back to Crescent&#8212;are throw-ins,
      kindred situations not contained in the printed&#8217; article.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With our townsman Green Campbell&#8217;s enviable
      mining success as an incentive, it has ever been my hope that I might
      someday also strike it rich&#8212;and mining seemed to offer the best
      lure. I therefore joined a group of Wetmore and Horton men in an effort to
      rejuvenate a gold mine at Whitepine, Colorado, twenty miles north of
      Sargent on the narrow gauge branch of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande
      railroad. With the Wetmore group&#8212;Dr. Augustus Philip Lapham and wife
      Elzina Brown-Lapham; Jay Wellington Powers and wife Helen Hoyt-Powers;
      Charles Samuel Locknane and wife Coral Hutchison-Locknane; and Mr. C. A.
      Mann, the owner, backed by Scott Hopkins, Horton banker, and other moneyed
      men of that city, I spent a week at White pine looking things over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The mine was really six miles up the canyon from White
      pine&#8212;just beyond the abandoned town of Tomichi, not far from the
      &#8220;Top of the World.&#8221; Tomichi had been hit by a snow slide which
      wrecked a number of houses, killing several people. The residents,
      numbering about 1,000, had abandoned their homes and places of business,
      leaving the buildings intact&#8212;a true &#8220;Ghost Town.&#8221;
      Thinking in terms of the present, one might wonder why had the buildings
      been left to rot down? A mill had sawed the lumber on the site</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and in that out-of-the-way place,
      the material was not worth salvaging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The tunnel of the Mann mine was about 150 feet
      up-slope from the wagon road on the floor of the canyon, which road was
      also Main Street in Tomichi. To get up to the tunnel, the trail started
      several hundred feet up the gulch and then swung back around a projecting
      ledge where the footing was rather insecure. To negotiate it the men would
      use the lines off the harness. The women could remain at the wagon and
      watch the men fall, if such might be the case.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And here I pulled a boner&#8212;not my first, nor
      last, I frankly admit. I looked across to the &#8220;scary&#8221; ledge,
      and straight up to the tunnel&#8212;and then I started up on the run, the
      loose rock in places sliding me back almost as fast as I was gaining.
      However, I made the tunnel, completely exhausted. I did not sit down to
      rest. I fell down. And I crawled into the tunnel where there was ice&#8212;in
      July&#8212;and revived quickly. One of the men was hampered in that climb
      with a wooden leg, which afforded me ample time to recover before their
      arrival&#8212;but my own legs were still shaky as I eased myself around
      that projecting ledge, grabbing the strap now and then, while coming down.
      I don&#8217;t know how the first strap-holder got around without help&#8212;nor
      the last one, either.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Mann said I had taken a great risk; that he had
      called to me to come back; that the exertion required to negotiate that
      heap of sliderock was really too much for one unaccustomed to the high
      altitude; that he himself&#8212;a seasoned mountain man&#8212;would not
      have undertaken it for the whole mine. And, you know, after I had taken
      one peep at the spot of interest in the tunnel, I thought, &#8220;Neither
      would I.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The prospect did not look good to me&#8212;nor was I
      fooled by the enthusiasm of my inexperienced associates, but I wanted to
      go along with them. The other Wetmore men thought enough of the prospect
      to locate adjoining claims, naming them for their children&#8212;The
      Marsena, The Gracie, and The Marguerite. I had no child, not even a wife&#8212;so
      no claim. But I then and there made a resolve to learn something more
      about that enticing mining game, perhaps elsewhere. And in the final
      analysis I suppose I have.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Doctor Lapham was the principal exuder of enthusiasm,
      an inborn trait which came to the fore again in a big way on the train
      enroute to Salt Lake City. The Doctor had spent some time in the smoker,
      and came back to the coach all &#8220;hepped&#8221; up. Rubbing his hands
      together in his characteristic manner, he said he had gotten&#8212;on the
      qt&#8212;a tip from the newsboy that an observation car was to be hooked
      on at Gunnison, for the trip through Colorado&#8217;s most colorful
      canyon. The observation car would be on a siding to the left of our train&#8212;and
      that the favored few were to make a dash for it the moment the train
      stopped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Doctor was always putting forth his best efforts
      to make us all comfortable&#8212;and happy. He said he had bought a book
      of views, paying $2 for it, something he really didn&#8217;t care a whoop
      for&#8212;but he wanted to reward the boy for his kind tip. With an eye
      for business, the newsboy had also tipped off other passengers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The &#8220;observation&#8221; car was only a coalcar
      having temporary backless board seats placed crosswise of the car. One had
      to climb over the seats, or step across from one plank to another to get
      to the rear end of the car&#8212;all right for the fellow who had so
      recently clambered up the tunnel dump, but very awkward for the women and
      the man with the wooden leg.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Many of the passengers looked at the thing and went
      back to the coaches, and some abandoned their seats and went inside after
      the train started&#8212;but our men folk, being well to the rear and
      encumbered with helpless women whom they did not wish to lose just then,
      couldn&#8217;t even do that once the train headed into the Black Canyon of
      the Gunnison, a narrow gorge with 2800-foot almost perpendicular walls,
      following the serpentine course of the Gunnison river, on a steeply down
      grade, switching the &#8220;observation&#8221; car like a whipcracker from
      one black wall to the other. Hot cinders rained down on us so that we
      could look neither to the right, or the left&#8212;nor up. Now, Lap&#8217;s
      newsboy came aboard crying, &#8220;Goggles, goggles, goggles!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And the appreciative Doctor gave the boy some more
      money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We had done Denver, Colorado Springs, Manitou and Pike&#8217;s
      Peak&#8212;and Cripple Creek. And we had all climbed &#8220;Tenderfoot&#8221;
      Mountain while waiting over-night at Salida for train connection&#8212;and
      I individually had literally sat on the proverbial powderkeg for three
      hours during a twenty-mile overland drive. Mr. Mann had provided a spring
      wagon for the other members of the party, and I, being unexpected, was
      conducted to a freight wagon going our way. When told, near the end of the
      journey, that I was sitting on a box of dynamite I blew up&#8212;in
      spirit. But nowhere had we experienced anything so disappointing as this
      &#8220;observation&#8221; car ride. It is anchored in my memory as the one
      really big scene that beggared description.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">NOTE</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">The
      railroad through the Black Canyon of the Gunnison has been abandoned, and
      sightseers may now view this colorful canyon from their automobiles over a
      highway&#8212;a &#8220;highway,&#8221; mind you, more than a half mile
      down in a narrow slit in the earth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, again, my newspaper friend, William Allen White,
      of the Emporia Gazette, toured the western mining districts and wrote
      enthusiastically about some newly discovered mining opportunity in the
      west, known as Thunder Mountain. It stimulated my desire. I wrote William
      Allen, asking him if he would, as one newspaperman to another, advise me
      to try my luck at Thunder Mountain? His personal letter to me was even
      more optimistic than was his editorial. Like Horace Greely, his advice was
      substantially, &#8220;By all means go west, young man, and give it a try.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">But I did not fetch up at Thunder Mountain. On the advice
      of another friend, I dumped the proceeds from the sale of my newspaper,
      sight unseen, in a hole in Nevada</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">while the wise Mr. White kept on publishing his Gazette;
      wrote a best seller book, &#8220;A Certain Rich Man,&#8221; and got rich
      himself. His name and fame are to be perpetuated in the erection of a
      public library building in Emporia; while I, his misguided friend, still
      have my laurels to make. And, incidentally, as a mining man, after that
      first big blow, I never again heard of Thunder Mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now back to the desert&#8212;and the printed Crescent
      story.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our contribution here at Crescent, with a minimum of
      outside help, was a 500-foot tunnel driven into the side of a mountain&#8212;the
      rock shot with high assay in gold and silver and copper. But the cost of
      this work, though a dead loss and highly disheartening, was as nothing
      compared to the outlay for the 2197 feet of tunnels and shafts we have
      driven&#8212;also with a minimum of help&#8212;through solid rock on our
      Goodsprings claims, where production, though quite good at times, has
      never caught up with expenses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And the end is not yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">You can take it from me that a man has to be
      insensible to pain to laugh this off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On the train away back in the valley on this my first
      trip to Crescent, the conductor had pointed to a distant cluster of white
      flecks barely</span> <span>discernible</span> <span class="c2 c0">through
      the shimmering, sun-drenched haze that lies always, like a pall, over the
      desert, and said to me, &#8220;There she is&#8212;the biggest thing in all
      Nevada!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had become chummy with the conductor, and that
      chumminess increased mightily when we learned that we were both on the way
      to become millionaires&#8212;as we visualized it then&#8212;through the
      mining route. He told me that he knew my mining partner, that he had
      engaged Frank Williams to look after the assessment work on some claims he
      himself owned over in the Goodsprings district. And when I asked the
      conductor his name and made a move as if to write it down, he shook his
      head negatively and threw out his hands in a gesture of utter uselessness,
      and said, &#8220;Oh-hell, man, you couldn&#8217;t forget it as long as you
      are in this country. It&#8217;s Dry&#8212;just plain William Dry.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My friend&#8217;s parting words to me were a mixture
      of jocularity and serious hope. &#8220;Well, so long, old top,&#8221; he
      said. &#8220;See you again when we fetch up at the end of the rainbow.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And do you know, the next time I saw that conductor, two
      years later&#8212;and I might say before either of us had made any
      appreciable advances on the rainbow&#8217;s elusive end</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">he recognized me at once, and in offering his hand,
      said: &#8220;It&#8217;s Dry.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh-hell, man, don&#8217;t
      I know it!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And so it was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">That meeting was in Superintendent J. Ross Clark&#8217;s
      private car, hitched to the flyer. We had exchanged some correspondence
      before, and Ross wanted to tell me in as hopeful words as possible that
      the officials of his railroad were still watching the situation closely
      and would build a branch line into our district&#8212;to our claims and to
      his claims</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">just as soon as
      the required tonnage was assured. You see, J. Ross Clark, too, was
      possessed of the desire to harvest a quick fortune and owned mining claims
      across the flat from our claims in the Goodsprings district.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That meeting with J. Ross Clark bore fruit for me,
      though&#8212;and it was the means of holding up the Los Angeles Limited
      for an hour, as well. Several years later I had an important engagement at
      Goodsprings and was delayed seven hours in Pueblo on the way out there,
      owing to a change in time of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande trains. The best
      I could do then was to arrive in Salt Lake five minutes after the Limited&#8217;s
      leaving time, at one o&#8217;clock at night, with depots a mile apart.
      Failure to keep my appointment at Goodsprings would mean disappointment to
      others and a money loss to me, as well as a wasted trip. In desperation, I
      went to the up-town office of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande, and asked the
      agent there to try to have the Los Angeles train held for me at Salt Lake.
      Nothing doing. That important personage swelled up to full capacity and
      said, &#8220;Evidently, if the San Pedro people wanted to neighbor with my
      Company they would change their leaving time.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Next, I asked the conductor on the Rio Grande train to
      wire ahead for me&#8212;and I am happy to state he was a gentleman. Also
      he was a one-time miner. &#8220;Tried it once over at Aspen,&#8221; he
      told me. And right away there was a bond of sympathy, or something,
      between us. That conductor really wanted to help me. But, as he told me he
      had wired the San Pedro people several times without results, I had to
      think of some other way, for I wanted to make that Limited as a lost soul
      wants to make Paradise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was then I thought of J. Ross Clark. What was the
      good of making friends, if you could not use them? The Rio Grande
      conductor obligingly held his train for me at Green River, Utah, while I
      filed a message to the Superintendent of the San Pedro lines. We arrived
      in Salt Lake ten minutes ahead of time, and the conductor, pointing to a
      hack-stand, said to me, &#8220;Now hurry&#8212;the Los Angeles train may
      be a little late in getting away.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the San Pedro station I found the Limited all
      steamed up, ready to go&#8212;and I boarded it quickly, all out of breath.
      But there was no need for hurrying. Presently the conductor came along and
      asked me: &#8220;Did you come in on Rio Grande Three?&#8221; I told him I
      did. Then he asked, &#8220;First or second section?&#8221; I admitted that
      I didn&#8217;t know the train had been split up at Grand Junction. The
      conductor, wanting to be sure of his order, drew a yellow slip from his
      pocket, and re-read: &#8220;Hold for one or more passengers off Rio Grande
      Three.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m sure
      you are the man I&#8217;m holding for&#8212;but I&#8217;ll have to wait
      for the second section.&#8221; And it was an hour late.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I think perhaps Ross had put in his order the words
      &#8220;one or more&#8221; solely as a precaution against the possibility
      of being accused of showing partiality to his mining neighbor, in breaking
      rules. Anyway, J. Ross Clark had no call for worry. His brother, William
      A. Clark, a mining man, controlling, among other holdings, the fabulously
      rich United Verde mine at Jerome, Arizona, owned also forty-nine per cent
      of the San Pedro lines&#8212;and was at this time operating the road under
      a twenty-year control agreement. It is now in full control of the Union
      Pacific.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Limited was not scheduled to stop at Jean, Nevada,
      my destination. The regular procedure would have been for me to go on down
      the line forty miles or more and then double back on a local train. But
      when the Limited began slowing down on approaching Jean, the conductor
      said to me, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t jump&#8212;wait &#8216;till she stops.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The engineer climbed down from his cab. The conductor
      hopped off the train and yelled, &#8220;Hey, Bill, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;
      I knew what was wrong. And Bill knew; and the conductor knew; and possibly
      one other knew&#8212;but that was all. And whose business was it, anyway?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The lost hour had been made up before the train pulled
      into Caliente, Nevada, where it halted ten minutes. And, paradoxically, it
      gained another hour there in that ten minutes. Caliente&#8212;Mexican for
      hot&#8212;is where Pacific time begins.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Bill had left that division point &#8220;on time&#8221;
      and held to the fast schedule all the way. And I&#8217;ll bet Bill and his
      relief engineer landed the old Limited in Los Angeles on the dot</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">even though there were miles and
      miles of desert wasteland, with two high mountain ranges, and, finally, a
      beautiful irrigated valley with orange groves and banks and banks of
      rose.s, yet to be crossed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As the Limited started to move again the conductor
      threw me a last cheerful word: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have only a little way
      to walk.&#8221; And I could only hope that there was no one to report that
      conductor&#8212;nor my friend Ross.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">You see, it was Dry again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">All about lay the eternal waste of the desert and
      mountain slopes, barren and desolate, walled in that arid corner of the
      world.</span>

      <span class="c12 c0">Not Hitherto Published</span> <span class="c12">&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">1947</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">To round out the foregoing story, I might say here
      that my wife was a guest for the week during my absence in Crescent, at
      Mrs. Yount&#8217;s hotel in Goodsprings. Sam Yount, the landlady&#8217;s
      husband, was leading merchant, postmaster, private banker&#8212;and miner.
      And he backed the hotel proposition too. The sleeping quarters of the
      hotel were a detached row of ground-floor rooms close by the main
      structure. It was before the building in Goodsprings of the Southern
      Nevada Hotel, said at the time to have been the most commodious hotel in
      the state. It was before the camp boasted a newspaper, even before the
      camp got electricity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My wife was not versed in the ways of the West; and
      she had some misgivings about making this stop-over on the desert,
      particularly because of the lateness of our train, while on our way to
      visit my people in California. I had told her that of the many times I had
      been out there I had never seen a gun-toting man&#8212;and that there was
      a fixed impression that it would be about as much as a man&#8217;s life
      was worth to molest a woman.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This trip was made at a time following the great flood
      that had wiped out all the railroad bridges for many miles along the
      Meadow Valley Wash, in eastern Nevada. Owing to a slow track, our train,
      due in Jean in the forenoon, did not arrive until near midnight. There
      were no accommodations at Jean when I was last out there, and I had told
      Myrtle that, as we would now miss the stage, we might have to sit in the
      depot until morning, or walk ten miles across the desert to Goodsprings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Frankly, she was not of a mind to do anything of the
      kind. She said we could remain on the train, go on to Los Angeles, and
      maybe stop at Goodsprings on our return trip&#8212;or we could, as far as
      she was concerned, pass it up altogether. I pointed out that we could
      hardly do this, with her trunk and all her fine clothes&#8212;clothes she
      didn&#8217;t need at all&#8212;checked through to Jean. And besides, we
      would be returning by way of San Francisco.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Remember, I had told her that I had never seen a gun
      toter in the West. Remember also that this was before Crescent. Then,
      imagine my surprise, and the wife&#8217;s renewed misgivings, when, on
      getting off at Jean, the first and only man to be seen had a murderous
      looking six-shooter strapped on him. And the wife had so little respect
      for my veracity as to tell me right out loud that in her best judgement I
      had purposely misrepresented matters to her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">George Fayle, whom I had known in Goodsprings</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">associated with Sam Yount&#8212;had
      come over to the railroad to engage in the mercantile business. He owned a
      general store, a restaurant, and was building a hotel. This made matters
      fine for us&#8212;almost. Fayle was postmaster, and handled pouch mail
      between the postoffice and the trains. The gun he carried was only
      routine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">George Fayle took us to a ground-floor room in his
      unfinished hotel. The room had wallboard partitions, bed upon springs flat
      on the floor, with a blanket hung across the outside door opening, leaving
      one-fourth of the space with nothing but thin desert air between us and
      the unknown. George did not tell us what kind of characters he was
      harboring beyond the cardboard&#8212;but he did wish us a pleasant good
      night, and, patting his six-shooter, said we would be perfectly safe, as
      is.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the wife did not readily catch the spirit of the
      West. I had told her that the desert was overrun with lizards and
      sidewinder rattlesnakes, the poisonous kind that travel in spiral form
      with head up ready for a strike at all times. She put in most of the
      remainder of the night watching the 18-inch opening between the blanket
      and the floor&#8212;precisely for what, she could not be sure. Luckily
      there was no wind. The blanket hung limp throughout the night. I can swear
      to that. Two of a kind, you might say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">At breakfast, George told me there had been a manhunt the
      day before over in the country west of Goodsprings</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">that an escaped convict was reportedly holed up in the
      hills east of Sandy. That would be in the neighborhood of our lead mine.
      The wife took this in without comment</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but it was plain to be seen that she was stowing it away for
      future consideration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Frank and I had returned from our tour of
      inspection at Crescent, after nightfall, we found the Good-springs camp in
      an awful state of alarm. My wife, fully dressed, was sitting upright in
      the middle of the bed in our ground-floor room, afraid to put foot on the
      floor. She had been so since shortly after dusk. Dusk&#8212;that
      indeterminate translucent veil which, like a mist, screens and magnifies,
      transposing even the most common objects into phantom figures.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">She had heard a scraping noise, likely a block away,
      but at such times the imagination does tricks to one&#8217;s reasoning. In
      her state of nervous tension, it was but natural for her to imagine that
      indistinct noise had come from under the bed, the obvious place for an
      intruder to hide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Ordinarily Myrtle was not given to such fits of
      timidity. But she had entered the country under trying conditions, and
      therefore was not prepared for the many unexpected irregularities. We had
      not counted on our train being so far behind time as to land us out there
      in the middle of the night. With my memory of the surroundings as I last
      knew them, it required a lot of silent argument with myself to get up
      courage to subject her to the risk we must necessarily take in finding
      accommodations of any sort, at Jean. I knew there were ten miles of desert
      on either side of the railroad station. That the country was not inhabited
      might or might not have been in our favor. Certainly, it presaged
      loneliness&#8212;and it was dark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">A woman at the hotel in Goodsprings thought she had
      glimpsed the deadly thing, at dusk, near the sleeping quarters&#8212;and
      Myrtle&#8217;s door had been left open for a brief spell while she was
      out. Or rather the door had been found open on her return&#8212;she just
      wasn&#8217;t sure how it was. Myrtle informed me that all the other women
      in camp were just as frightened as she was. And she bade me look under the
      bed, forthwith.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The thing I was supposed to make sure was&#8212;or wasn&#8217;t</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">there, had an overall length of
      about two feet, a width of four to five inches, an inch or so less in
      height when inactive&#8212;and it was a little pot-bellied. It was rusty
      in color, with yellowish spots distributed the full length of its body. It
      had a fat meaty tail, and a broad ugly looking head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There really was something alive under the bed. It
      moved. Its eyes moved toward me. Also there were now two people upon the
      bed. And simultaneously the door swung open, as if the devil was in
      cahoots with the thing, bent on letting in all the demons of a wicked
      world. I had hit the bed on the bounce with a jarring thud, causing the
      door to swing in, as it invariably did when not securely latched. And the
      cat &#8220;hightailed it&#8221; out into the night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the house cat was not the thing so much dreaded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Springer&#8217;s Gila Monster, a lizard-like
      reptile, even more poisonous than the rattlesnake, was on the loose. It
      had got out of its place of confinement two days back, and diligent search
      by the whole camp had failed to locate it. On the third day, however, the
      Monster was found at a water-hole, an old trench dug years before by our
      former Wetmore citizen, Green Campbell. The camp demanded that the reptile
      be killed immediately.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Elwood Thomas, also formerly of Wetmore, was a close
      neighbor to Mr. Springer, and he had carried the word of caution to
      Myrtle. It was all so very exciting&#8212;even worse than a panther scare.
      And, miraculously, the wife was to experience that one too before leaving
      the Goodsprings camp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">We were to go with Frank Williams to stay over Sunday at
      our lead mine, which was twelve miles over the</span> <span></span> <span
      class="c2 c0">mountain range on the west side. The daily stage (except
      Sunday) passed within a few hundred yards of the mine. Frank and I started
      to walk over, at sunup, on Saturday morning. Myrtle was to go over on the
      stage in the afternoon.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/image332.jpg" alt="image332" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/image332.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c2 c0">To make a short cut, Frank and I took a burro trail at
      the summit, near the Columbia mine. While trailing that rugged miner ten
      yards in the rear, going down on the west side, I sprained my right ankle,
      badly, rolling down the slope almost to where Frank was&#8212;my camera
      trailing in the wake, taking the bumps.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We stopped for a brief rest at the Hoosier mine&#8212;formerly
      owned by Frank&#8217;s uncle, Elwood Thomas&#8212;where the miners were
      taking out zinc ore, a new find in that district. And &#8220;tenderfoot&#8221;
      though I was, I made a discovery there which had escaped my seasoned
      miner-partner for a whole year. At least I thought I had done this to him.
      Frank had cut through a 12-foot body of identical appearing stuff in
      running the tunnel, and had several tons of it ricked up on the dump. It
      would require an assay to convince him that we had a zinc mine, as well as
      a lead mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In accordance with the miners&#8217; code we were
      invited to stop at the Hoosier shack in the foothills and get our dinners.
      By this time my swollen ankle was hurting so badly that I preferred not to
      stop until we could get out to the stage road a mile farther on&#8212;but
      Frank said it would be an insult to the Hoosier boys for us to pass them
      by. And besides he was hungry. Also, according to the miners&#8217; code
      Frank had to wash his dirty dishes. This is a must in the mining country.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/image333.jpg" alt="image333" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/image333.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c2 c0">This is where I went down&#8212;second time. Took this
      picture while waiting for the stage. Frank&#8217;s mail box is about a
      mile around the bend of the road. The trail&#8212;foot path&#8212;going
      over the mountain starts near the right edge of this view&#8217; and tops
      the mountain starts near the right edge of this view, and tops the
      mountain at the head of a canyon, on the other side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span>We reached the stage road about two hours before the stage was due.
      Frank walked on three miles farther to the mine, and I hobbled along until
      within a mile of &#8220;our&#8221;</span> <span class="c2 c0">mountain&#8212;then
      my ankle toppled me over again, and I lay there with my head shaded by a
      single sagebrush. As the sun moved along on its westward course&#8212;which
      of course it didn&#8217;t do at all&#8212;I had to scratch gravel
      frequently, sliding on my back, to keep my head shielded from the burning
      desert sun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The stage-driver let us off at Frank&#8217;s mail box,
      and Myrtle had a hard time helping me over the hump and down the canyon to
      the mine. We took the short cut over the mountain instead of going a mile
      or more around on the wagon road; through a saddle-back, and then up the
      canyon to the mine, which would have been less arduous. We were carrying
      provisions for six meals for the three of us. There was water at the mine.
      It had rained a month before, and Frank had scooped up the water out of a
      ditch. No fiction in this. Water really &#8220;keeps&#8221; out there&#8212;when
      in an underground house, anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We had overlooked the need for candles and coffee&#8212;or
      rather they were missing from the pack. Acting on Frank&#8217;s
      suggestion, Myrtle went out on the mountain side, gathered leaves from the
      lowly sage brush&#8212;and we had our tea. But the absence of candles was
      a more serious matter. Frank hunted the underground house, and the
      tunnels, finally finding a two-inch piece of candle at the far end of a
      500-foot tunnel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The wife and I slept&#8212;no, bunked&#8212;the first
      night in the underground house. To get into the place we had to hug a wall
      as we approached the door to avoid dropping into a 60-foot shaft by the
      side of the entrance, where Frank had taken out $65 worth of RICH silver
      ore&#8212;at a cost of $500 for digging the hole.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There were mice, and probably lizards too, running
      over our bed on the floor. Little lizards were very active on the outside,
      in the daytime. And Frank and I had killed a rattlesnake while strolling
      about over the grounds the year before. The crack under the door was big
      enough to let in almost anything short of a panther.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, a big body of ore protruding from the ceiling
      directly over our bed looked as if it might slip from its moorings with
      the slightest jar, and there was some jarring force at work all through
      the night. Grains of crushed limestone, like sand, sifted down upon us
      almost continously. Myrtle spent the night lighting, blowing out, and
      relighting that little piece of candle. In this way she made it last until
      morning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The next night&#8212;Sunday night&#8212;we slept, or
      rather bunked, on an ore-sorting table out on the tunnel dump, under the
      stars. Frank had taken his bedroll a hundred yards down the canyon to find
      level &#8220;ground&#8221; on which to make his spread. I had sent an old
      trunk filled with bedding including a couple of pillows the year before.
      The wife</span> <span class="c2 c0">thought Frank had been a little lax in
      the matter of laundering same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c0">After going over the mountain (at left) we</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">Myrtle and I</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">came
      down the canyon to the mine. The tunnel dump shows between the two arms of
      the mountain</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">about a half
      mile away. Getting down from the top was tough. I had to back down much of
      the way</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">and have a lot of
      help. Frank had said he would meet us at the mailbox</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">but he was taking lessons in French off a gramophone and
      did not show up until we were well along the way to the mine. Frank&#8217;s
      and Edith&#8217;s first tent house</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">part canvas</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">was
      built was built on this dump.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This, of course, was before Frank had gone East to
      study political economy. Also it was before he had brought back to the
      mine a New England school teacher called Edith, bearing his name. There
      was no laxity after Edith took charge. And, with this touch of &#8220;new
      life&#8221; on the job, the mine, besides yielding rich ore, sparingly,
      produced two fine little girls, Ruth and Helen&#8212;girls that grew up at
      the mine. With their father a graduate of Campbell University, Holton,
      Kansas, and their mother holding a teacher&#8217;s certificate, the girls
      didn&#8217;t fare badly, even in semi-isolation. As a matter of fact,
      district school was held for a time in their home, with their mother as
      teacher.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The home at this time was a four-room house on a 5-acre
      water claim&#8212;held in connection with the mining claims</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">on the edge of Mesquite Valley, one mile from the
      mine. There was a 75-foot dug well, with windmill, and running water in
      the house. And there were growing fruit trees, a vineyard in bearing, and a
      green&#8212;very green alfalfa patch. The two Williams girls represented
      two-sevenths of the possible pupils for the school.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then a little green school house was erected not more
      than three hundred yards from their door&#8212;with Miss Leah Lytle as
      first teacher&#8212;where all seven of the miners&#8217; children studied
      their lessons, romped and played among the sage and mesquite. While so
      doing, Helen Williams was bitten by a rattlesnake. She was taken to Las
      Vegas, the nearest big town, fifty miles away for treatment&#8212;and that
      move spelled the end of the little green school house in the Mesquite
      Valley so far as the two girls were concerned. They finished their
      schooling in Las Vegas, graduating from the high school there. Then, when
      Rex Ewing, Frank William&#8217;s closest mining neighbor, moved to Las
      Vegas to capture some of the prevailing high wages, the school blew up.
      Rex had supplied the other five pupils. The sequence of events as set down
      here may be faulty&#8212;but were I able to chronicle them in order, the
      result would be the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This, I believe, is noteworthy. Besides the single
      claim purchased by Frank and me from S. C. Root, operator on Bonanza Hill,
      one mile south of our holdings, Frank Williams located three more
      adjoining claims, taking in practically all the surface ore croppings on
      this mountain&#8212;and recorded them in one group, which meant that the
      work done on any one claim of the group, if extensive enough, would
      satisfy the $100 annual assessment for each claim.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">There was, however, a small showing of ore apparently
      like the zinc at the Hoosier mine just outside those claims, on the west,
      close to the wagon road Frank had blasted out, at considerable expense, to
      get up to the tunnel he was driving. There were no other operators on that
      mountain. Frank was lonesome. He wanted neighbors. Old man Ewing and son
      Rex, nomad sojourners in Goodsprings, were invited to come out and try
      their luck on that small cropping.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The Ewings struck pay ore almost from the start, and
      began shipments, while Frank was still driving his tunnel</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">with ever increasing high hope. Frank&#8217;s wagon
      road proved to be a big asset for his new neighbors. Rex Ewing also mined
      commercial lead ore back on the high end of his claims, which was brought
      down to the wagon road by burro pack. Large trucks now travel that wagon
      road right up to Frank&#8217;s ore bin, at the mouth of the tunnel, and
      take off with five tons to the load.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At this juncture I might say that though Frank has
      spent fifty-five of his seventy-six years&#8212;as of this date, 1947&#8212;in
      the Nevada mines, he has met with only two accidents, and neither of them
      was actually in the mines. He was working alone at our Crescent claims,
      and by way of a little deviation from routine work, undertook to blow open
      a big boulder&#8212;just curious to see what was inside. It was not in the
      way&#8212;and it would have told him nothing of advantage had he proved
      his suspicion that it contained gold, for gold was showing in the ledge up
      slope from which the boulder had been dislodged. What I said to Frank when
      he told me he meant to waste a day in blowing open that big rock does not
      matter now. Nor did it matter then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Even before Frank had started to drill the boulder, while
      clearing away some loose rock, it rolled half-over, pinning him
      underneath. I judged the boulder would weigh two tons, maybe more&#8212;but
      a smaller rock had prevented it from crushing the life out of Frank. Two
      miners were working, in sight, across the</span> <span>canyon</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">about a quarter mile away&#8212;and Frank called and
      hollered for seven hours without attracting them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, here is something that, from my power of
      reasoning, is inexplicable. There are, however, people who would have a
      ready explanation for it. Elwood Thomas, Frank&#8217;s uncle, had driven
      his team of ponies from Goodsprings over to Searchlight, ten miles beyond
      Crescent, and was returning late in the afternoon, aiming to go by way of
      Crescent, as it was shorter and a better road.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Elwood told me that when he had come to the by-road
      leading through the canyon past his nephew&#8217;s location, he naturally
      thought of Frank, and as he drove on toward Crescent he began to think he
      should have gone the other road. He said, &#8220;Something told me to turn
      around&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t pretend to say what it was&#8212;but it was
      so strong, so insistent, that I did turn around after I had gone a mile.&#8221;
      He found Frank still hollering for help&#8212;but his calls were now very
      feeble. With the help of the two miners Frank had been trying to attract,
      Elwood got him out from under the boulder, loaded him into the wagon, and
      drove on down through the canyon and across the big flat to Nipton, the
      railroad station. Frank was put on the train and taken to a hospital in
      Los Angeles. He was paralyzed from the waist down. Six weeks in the
      hospital fixed him up as good as ever. Frank was on his own then&#8212;that
      is, had no insurance. The expense was terrific. I think Frank never did
      get his curiosity satisfied about the boulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As his inactive partner, I cautioned Frank against
      working alone in those remote places&#8212;but it did no good. He said he
      was safer working alone in the mines than I was when riding the trains
      between Kansas and Nevada. When I first went into the mining country, I
      observed that practically all prospectors had partners. I asked an
      Irishman (a miner) why was it so? He said, &#8220;And how the divvel would
      a man pull his-self up out of a hole widout a partner?&#8221; But there
      was a more important reason. It was for protection against accidents such
      as Frank had just experienced.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Frank&#8217;s second accident, more serious than the
      other one, was at our Goodsprings mine, while loading out vanadium ore on
      Government contract, in more recent years. He was unable to tell how it
      happened. The trucker had left with a 5-ton load, and Frank was &#8220;waiting
      around&#8221; for him to come back for a second load. When the truck
      driver got back from his ten-mile trip over the mountain, he found Frank
      wandering around down on the road below the ore bin, in a dazed condition&#8212;really
      worse than that. Frank wrote me later that he remembered standing on the
      ore bin after the trucker had gone with his load, and thought he must have
      fallen off&#8212;but remembered nothing more. The ore bin is built against
      the slope of the mountain, having a flat top about 16x20 feet, on a level
      of the tunnel, with car-track extending to the outer edge, where a drop
      would be about 18 feet&#8212;and less, (to nothing), at the upper end of
      the ore bin. Frank did not say where he was standing in the last moments
      of consciousness&#8212;but a fall from anywhere near the upper edge would
      mean a rough tumble all the way down to the road.</span>

    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">When Frank was taken to the Las Vegas hospital, it was
      found he had a broken collarbone, a bad head injury</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">and a touch of pneumonia. He remained two months in the
      hospital, at state expense, plus $90 per month compensation</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">with final payment of $1,500, on a basis of one-fourth

      <span class="c2 c0">The Williams girls are both married and live in Las
      Vegas. Helen is the wife of Vaughn Holt, a barber. When I called at her
      home in 1941 she had a very sweet little girl not quite a year old. Ruth&#8217;s
      husband, Charles Thomas, is a linotype operator on Frank Garside&#8217;s
      Daily newspaper. He is not the Charley Thomas who grew up in Wetmore and
      spent many years in Nevada. That Charley was the son of Elwood Thomas and
      was Frank William&#8217;s cousin. And it so happens that Ruth now takes
      her grandmother Williams&#8217; maiden name&#8212;Ruth Thomas.</span>

      <span class="c0">Frank Garside, postmaster at Las Vegas, and publisher of
      the Daily Review there, formerly lived in Atchison. His aunt, Frances
      Garside&#8212;well known to me at that time</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">made a record writing &#8220;Globe Sights&#8221; for
      Ed Howe&#8217;s Daily Globe, back in the &#8220;Gay Nineties.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now the panther. Maybe it was only a wildcat, but
      its scream was enough to put fear in the &#8220;sleepers&#8221; out on the
      tunnel dump. The varmint came yowling down the canyon, fifteen feet away
      from our bunk, going on down the trail Frank had taken with his bedroll.
      Frank said the thing had been heard several times before, and he was not
      sure if it was a panther, or a wildcat. Panthers&#8212;called cougars in
      the west&#8212;he said, were very much in evidence down on the Rim; that
      is, the high bank of the Colorado river. And something very like the
      cougar in habit had killed a calf in the valley, close by. Myrtle regarded
      the thing as a threatening menace, and had it not been for that exposed
      shaft at the entrance of the underground house, she doubtless would have
      made a break for shelter. And I think that, notwithstanding my black and
      blue ankle, I should have followed pronto.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, Myrtle was compensated for all this by the
      fact&#8212;vouched for by Frank Williams&#8212;that she was the first
      white woman to set foot on that mountain. By the same line of reasoning,
      Edith Willams was, I suppose, if we can be sure Frank knows his history,
      the second, and probably the last, white woman to climb Hunter mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Looking across the canyon, and gesturing toward the
      mountain-side where some work had been done, Myrtle laughingly said to
      Frank and me, &#8220;I suppose you two old grizzled miners think that
      &#8216;Thar&#8217;s gold in them thar hills&#8217;.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle had trod some pretty rocky ground, literally
      and figuratively, since coming into camp&#8212;besides heating gallons of
      water from time to time at the mine to bathe my sprained ankle&#8212;and
      she certainly was entitled to indulge in a little &#8220;fun&#8221; at our
      expense. Myrtle had quoted correctly, but that &#8220;grizzled&#8221;
      reference belonged to quite another class of miners. And I may say this
      was the first and only time I had ever heard that bewhiskered old saying
      while in the mining country. It was of course a carryover from another
      era. And, had she not questioned my statement about the gun-toters, I
      should have told her that there are no such animals in the mining country
      now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Myrtle was holding in her hand a gold nugget&#8212;real,
      glittering, yellow gold</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">about
      the size of a walnut, and Frank knew instantly its source. She had taken
      it out of my pocket&#8212;but I doubt if Frank knew positively, until this
      minute, that I had it. He said to me, &#8220;You better drop it in that
      shaft over there by the underground house. There&#8217;s but one place
      that it could have come from&#8212;and if exhibited around here, it might
      get somebody in trouble.&#8221; He hastened to say, however, that it would
      not be me; that he was sure that I had got it legitimately, though maybe a
      little less openly than the $10 nugget I had secured when he and I were
      exploring the depths of the famous Quartette mine at Searchlight. That&#8217;s
      the place where someone had said before the camp was named that it would
      take a searchlight to locate pay ore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;Yeah, drop it in the shaft and have
      someone in the future find it, and then spend thousands of dollars trying
      to locate its source.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">He said, &#8220;Any miner who knows his stuff would
      know that it didn&#8217;t originate in this lime formation. It&#8217;s
      straight out of a porphyry dike&#8212;and was, until you got hold of it,
      closely guarded under lock and key.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I could have told him that I knew all this, but a more
      brilliant idea struck me&#8212;leastwise just for the moment I thought it
      was bright. But, then, on second thought, what if the assay on our big
      body of material I had been so sure was just like the Hoosier zinc, should
      prove me wrong. Well, anyway, I would &#8220; shoot the works.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I said, &#8220;It strikes me that there are some men
      around here who count themselves miners that do not exactly at all times
      know their stuff.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle said, &#8220;Now, now&#8212;don&#8217;t
      commence on that zinc again.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll still
      bet my old hat that it is zinc.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Frank said, quickly, &#8220;If it&#8217;s zinc, I&#8217;ll
      eat your old hat</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and do it
      with relish, too, brother.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;And in that case, if you win, smart boy, you
      still stand to lose your hat,&#8221; said Myrtle, to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I believe Frank had already begun to see the light,
      sense a probability, cherish a hope. Although lead ore running 71 and 72
      per cent by the carload had been shipped, the present lean condition of
      our lead mine could well stand bolstering with a big body of zinc. But of
      course he would not want to admit, first off, that his &#8220;tenderfoot&#8221;
      partner had stumbled onto something of such vital importance. In school,
      and at countryside lyceums back home, Frank was a top negative debater&#8212;always
      on the &#8220;contrary&#8221; side. And it was probably the stubborn Welsh
      in him that caused him to stick by his guns now&#8221;His father had been
      a miner back in Wales&#8212;in the identical neighborhood&#8217; that
      afterwards became known as the locale of the movie, &#8220;How Green Was
      My Valley?&#8221;:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I do not know the result of the assay made by Harry
      Riddell for Frank&#8212;but I do know that Frank wrote me, that
      fortunately, I was going to be minus an old hat, someday. But, for the
      present, would I send him $500 to start operations on &#8220;our lucky
      zinc find?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">An assay made for me, by C. S. Cowan, whom I met on
      the train, and who was assayer at W. A. Clark&#8217;s United Verde mine,
      Jerome, Arizona, showed fifty-five per cent zinc. Assayer Cowan wrote me
      that it was a big surprise to him. He had told me he doubted if the sample
      would show any zinc.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the crude, it shipped out by the carload at
      forty-three percent. But at that, it was no bonanza. Western smelters
      could not handle that class of ore&#8212;and the freight rate to the zinc
      smelters in the gas fields of southern Kansas, was $500 a car.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Unlike the dark sulphides of the Joplin (Mo.) and
      Galena (Kans.) district, where paying mines were operating on six per cent
      zinc, ours was a carbonate ore, running to high values. It was light in
      color, with the richer ore comparatively light in weight. Frank said it
      would likely, as she goes down, turn to sulphides and be more permanent,
      with less values.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But, brother&#8212;&#8221;she&#8221; didn&#8217;t go
      down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">By way of explanation, I might say here that on the
      preceding Friday, Frank and I paid a visit to the Keystone mine near the
      summit, north of the Goodsprings highway. Situated in a porphyry zone, it
      was the only gold mine of importance in the district&#8212;with an output
      of more than a million dollars up to that time. And it might be consoling
      to my partner, who at that time (1907) had spent sixteen of his
      thirty-seven years working in the Nevada mines, to state here what he
      already knows&#8212;in fact, he&#8217;s the source of my information&#8212;that
      Jonas Taylor, working a silver deposit on his claim, allowed the Keystone
      gold ledge to lay dormant for three years after he had discovered it. But
      when he did finally wake up to its possibilities, three days work rewarded
      him with a four-foot vein of gold ore running $1,000 to the ton&#8212;in
      shipments.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Our former Wetmore citizen, Green Campbell, did not get
      in on this&#8212;but he located, and his estate still owns the Golden
      Chariot, adjoining. And one of Green&#8217;s associates, William Smith,
      hurriedly fetched his friend Samuel Godbe over from Pioche, and after one
      look at the uncovered ledge, the latter played a winning hand in a big
      game without risking any chips. Mr. Godbe asked for, and received from Mr.
      Taylor, a thirty day option on one-half interest for $20,000. Mr. Godbe
      then rushed to San Francisco and sold half of a half-interest to Mr.
      Perry, a banker acquaintance, for $20,000 cash. A few months later Mr.
      Perry sold his quarter interest to Mr. Blake, of Denver, for $40,000. And
      nobody had lost any money</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We had driven Sam Yount&#8217;s big sorrel mare up
      Kerby gulch to the Kerby mine, owned by the Campbell estate. From there,
      we walked maybe a couple of miles&#8212;a pretty rough climb&#8212;to the
      Keystone, arriving at about 10 o&#8217;clock. The camp cook, the only man
      above ground, thought the miners were working on the 800-foot level. Frank
      said he knew his way around&#8212;that we would go down in the mine and
      contact them. He had worked in the Keystone a short while before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Like an addict bucking a slot machine always hoping for
      the next turn to crack the jackpot, Frank had put his last dollar into the
      development of our own prospect, and consequently had been compelled to
      work in other mines to get a stake. And since it was not in the cards for
      Frank to distinguish himself, as part owner of the Kansas-Nevada mine</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">and also, in later years, as if
      finding a good mother for his &#8220;kids&#8221; while on that political
      economy excursion into the East was not enough, he cashed in on that
      outlay by getting himself elected for the fourth time, to the legislature</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">assembly, it is called in Nevada.
      Then to Reno as Regent of the University of Nevada. Also, still later, he
      started a one-man crusade against gambling. But in Nevada&#8212;well, it
      was slow work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">And, mind you, we ourselves, Frank and I, were at that
      very time stuck in a mine gamble which might&#8212;and did</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">keep us feeding the &#8220;kitty&#8221; for years
      before we could know whether or not we would ever be able to pull out with
      a winning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We lighted candles and started down by way of an
      incline shaft. The Keystone doubtless had a vertical shaft, I believe back
      on higher ground, straight down to the 1,000 foot level, with safety cage,
      operated with power. Likely a standard shaft! under state supervision,
      similar to the one which Frank and I were eased down to the 1100-foot
      level of the Quartette mine at Searchlight&#8212;on a day off from our
      inspection at Crescent. My cousin, Ella Bristow-Montgom-ery-Walter, lived
      in Searchlight, and Joe Walter, her husband, had taken time off from his
      barber business to show us around. Frank had seen the manager of the
      Quartette, likely through the solicitation of Joe, give me a gold nugget,
      worth maybe $10.,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I did not collect these rich specimens for their
      intrinsic value&#8212;but rather for study and comparison. Our hope for
      gold at that time lay at Crescent, between Goodsprings and Searchlight.
      The specimens from neighboring camps could be helpful in determining our
      course of development.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the Keystone, we had gone down that incline shaft
      to the 700-foot level before the tenderfoot in me began to assert itself.
      We had walked down the incline easily enough, then climbed straight down
      on a ladder for maybe twenty-five feet&#8212;and then repeated by incline
      and ladder, gaining distance away from the portal, as well as in depth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the 700-foot level, Frank had a sudden notion that
      we might be heading for trouble. There were crosscuts going out from the
      various levels, and the miners might be working in any one of them. And it
      was about time for the shots to be fired. He said we could get out quicker
      if we were above the works when the powder smoke began to come out. And I
      was positive that I had had enough. The mine was dripping water&#8212;and
      my nerves were shot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">It gave me a &#8220;weak&#8221; feeling not unlike I had
      experienced when Frank took me about 300 feet back into the tunnel at our
      lead mine to demonstrate a drilling, and the firing of a shot. It was late
      in the afternoon, almost sundown. Frank said we would have to hurry, as
      daylight was running out on us, and we yet had to make our beds out on the
      dump&#8212;that is, find places where the crushed rock had been trampled
      down to some semblance of smoothness. He said he was drilling in soft
      white lime; that the blue lime at the contact two hundred feet farther in,
      for which the tunnel was projected, and where, it was confidently
      believed, we would encounter a big body of lead, was hard as granite. He
      drilled a hole sixteen inches deep, then cut a suitable length of fuse,
      fitted a dynamite cap to one end, tapped it together lightly with his
      steel drill&#8212;then shockingly gave that dynamite cap, having a
      500-pound explosive force</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">which
      alone has been known to blow a man&#8217;s hand off when hit with a hammer&#8212;a
      final clinch with his teeth. He had a little tool for clinching the caps,
      but he didn&#8217;t want to waste the time to fetch it. He &#8220;hooted&#8221;
      at my protest of that dangerous performance. We were about twelve miles
      from civilization, and I didn&#8217;t relish the prospect of being left
      alone out there in the night. He slit a stick of dynamite with his knife&#8212;dynamite
      has been known to explode with rough handling&#8212;but he eased my fears
      by saying a cow had chewed up a stick of dynamite without harm. He
      inserted the capped end of the fuse in the slit, squeezed it together and
      dropped it in the hole. He filled the hole with fine rock drillings, and
      nonchalantly tamped it with an iron bar. He lighted the fuse with a match&#8212;and
      said it was time for us to skedaddle to the portal. No report. Frank said
      he would go back in the tunnel and dig it out, and fire the charge. Now, I
      did protest. I told him to defer that job until morning. He thought maybe
      it would be best, said that a fuse would sometimes hangfire. Dusk was upon
      us. However, we found suitable spots for bedding down, and I rolled up in
      nice clean blankets I had purchased in Los Angeles the day before&#8212;and,
      using a &#8220;soft&#8221; white lime rock for a pillow, slept the sleep
      of a budding plutocrat. And, believe it or not, that delayed shot waked me
      before dawn. Frank had performed the dangerous task of digging out that
      dud, and reloaded the hole. He said, &#8220;It was no job for a simpering
      tenderfoot to watch. And furthermore, if you will stick around me you&#8217;ll
      learn something.&#8221; And that was no boastful exaggeration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Keystone manager took us to the administration
      building, unlocked a door, and showed us five tons of very rich gold ore
      piled in one corner of the office. A narrow strip of one inch and less&#8212;along
      the hanging wall of a four-foot vein of $40 ore&#8212;shot with particles
      of pure gold, averaging $72,000 to the ton, had produced that $360,000
      pile of Keystone wealth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The manager was very kind to me. He pointed out some
      extremely rich specimens, and watched me &#8220;eat &#8216;em up&#8221;</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">figuratively, of course. I knew
      that it would have been unethical, if not worse, for him to have offered
      to give me a specimen, especially at a time when all that &#8220;high-grading&#8221;
      was going on in Nevada, particularly at the Goldfield Consolidated Mines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Satisfied that I had been sufficiently impressed, the
      manager turned to Frank&#8212;they were old associates, you know&#8212;suggesting
      that he might be interested in having a look at the work-sheet,
      blue-print, or something of other entertaining, on the desk. When Frank
      was sufficiently absorbed, with back to me, the manager stepped out the
      door, &#8220;whowhoed&#8221; and gestured&#8212;probably held up two
      fingers</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">which I afterwards
      interpreted to mean he was making known to someone he would have guests
      for dinner. And I still think I read the signals aright. Anyway, my
      hurriedly selected specimen had only the gold content of one double-eagle&#8212;and
      that would have been grand larceny in my state.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I do not know if the Keystone maintained a
      change-room, such as the management of the Goldfield Consolidated was
      compelled to install about this time to cope with its &#8220;high-graders,&#8221;
      But the Keystone had had experience with &#8220;high-graders.&#8221; Frank
      said that in earlier days, off-shift miners would ride the ore-wagons down
      to the mill in the Mesquite Valley near the town of Sandy, dropping rich
      pieces of gold ore by the roadside for their confederates, following on
      foot, to gather up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At the Consolidated Mines in Goldfield every miner on
      coming off shift, besides having to shed his work clothes before he could
      pass the doorkeeper to get to his street clothes, was compelled to say
      &#8220;Ah!&#8221; Perhaps you can think of some other way a stripped miner
      might conceal a bit of gold? The miners did. And the detection of that
      unique manner of &#8220;high-grading&#8221; precipitated a riot that had
      to be quelled by the state militia. The Union miners agreed,
      magnanimously, to submit to the new order of things&#8212;provided that
      they be permitted to name the doorkeeper from their own ranks. The
      Consolidated had broken into some extremely rich ore, streaks of almost
      pure gold&#8212;and the miners were averse to overlooking any bets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back at the lead-zinc mine, Myrtle told us what she
      had experienced in Goodsprings during the week when Frank and I were at
      Crescent. As the wife of the partner of Frank Williams&#8212;no intent of
      implying self importance&#8212;she was at once taken into the hearts of
      the camp people. Perhaps her own personality was a factor. She had met, at
      the hotel, Mr and Mrs. Potter, of the Columbia mine; Mr and Mrs. McCarthy,
      (he was the surveyor); and Harry Riddell, the assayer&#8212;all late of
      Boston. And she had really begun to love the desert, with its
      ultra-sociable people. Even Mrs. Yount&#8217;s squaw cook&#8212;maybe she
      was only kitchen help&#8212;a Paiute Indian woman from up Pahrump way,
      Myrtle said, was friendly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And, best of all, the camp children had supplied her
      daily&#8212;except of course those two days when Mr. Springer&#8217;s Gila
      Monster had the run of the camp&#8212;with a bouquet of wild flowers
      gathered from the mountain slopes. She loved that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Also, she had enjoyed, particularly when with the
      children, watching a reddish-brown dog resembling a cocker spaniel, ride a
      horse, standing up behind a man. A prospector working a claim up near the
      summit, five or six miles out, rode a bay horse daily out of Goodsprings,
      to and from his work&#8212;always with the dog standing on the horse&#8217;s
      back. As it was a daily occurrence, the children had become accustomed to
      seeing the dog ride the horse&#8212;but they were especially anxious for
      Myrtle to view the spectacle, with them. Myrtle had met, and visited with,
      some of the children&#8217;s mothers. One of the women was from Soldier,
      Kansas, near our home. In fact, with faithful Elwood Thomas as escort,
      Myrtle had been pretty much all over the camp</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">except of course saloon row on the north side&#8212;Hobson
      street I believe it was called. Elwood had told her it was not the lowest
      spot in Nevada, but even so, it was no place for a lady.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Myrtle had now really caught the spirit of the West. She
      was actually planning on the spending of the yet undelivered profits of
      the mine, on a home in Goodsprings. Everyone had told her that we were on
      the high road to a big success. Our home would be on the &#8220;bench&#8221;
      near Charley Byram&#8217;s place, where we could be sure of getting water.
      Bachelor Charley Byram, I believe, had the only private well, with
      windmill, in Goodsprings. He was the son of August Byram, former partner
      of Green Campbell, in the sensationally rich Horn Silver mine at Frisco,
      Utah. Born in Atchison, Kansas, Charley was now</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">in Nevada and Los Angeles, where he lived with his mother
      and sister</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">-a typical
      Westerner, seemingly without the proper appreciation of a native son for
      his old home town. He said to me, &#8220;The last time I was back in
      Atchison, two years ago, I could have fired a shotgun down the full length
      of Commercial street without hitting a soul.&#8221; To one who knows the
      unobstructed and flat straightness of Commercial street, it seemed as if
      he should have been able to do better than that. Charley would have to up
      his sights and show marksmanship if he were to hit pay ore on his claims
      up in the porphyry zone. I believe he missed in this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Myrtle said she wanted flowers, lots of roses, and
      green grass&#8212;a show spot, sort of oasis in the desert as it were.
      Something that everybody else didn&#8217;t have. Well, I too had been
      caught by the spell. Why not let her have them? Contingent, however, on
      one little reservation. Only if, and when, the lead-zinc mine should give
      up its treasure. We couldn&#8217;t spend all that money living a prosaic
      life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Before leaving Goodsprings for California, Myrtle said
      to me, &#8220;Let&#8217;s come back this way. I&#8217;d love it. And since
      you think you are so good at discovering zinc overlooked by your partner,
      maybe YOU could, after all, find gold in &#8216;them thar hills&#8217;.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Might say here that eight years later Myrtle had the
      chance to repay the old miner, Elwood Thomas, for his kindness by
      entertaining him in our home. Elwood</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c0">just in from Nevada</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">came
      into the Wetmore hotel one evening about eight o&#8217;clock when I
      happened to be present. Also, Henry McCreery&#8212;sometimes
      affectionately called &#8220;Henry Contrary&#8221;&#8212;Elwood&#8217;s
      brother-in-law, was in the hotel office at the time. We had a good visit
      together. When Henry was ready to go home he said, &#8220;Well, Elwood, I&#8217;d
      like to ask you to go home with me for the night</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">but I&#8217;m afraid Becky wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;
      Becky Thornton was Henry&#8217;s sister and housekeeper&#8212;his wife
      Patience, Elwood&#8217;s sister, having passed on some years earlier.
      Elwood said, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right. Maybe I ought to go out and
      see the Old Man&#8221;</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">meaning
      his bachelor brother Manning, living a half mile east of town. Elwood was
      the oldest and Manning was the youngest in a family of seven children&#8212;but
      the older one was the younger in appearance. I said, &#8220;Come along
      with me, Elwood&#8212;I know Myrtle will be glad to see you.&#8221; And
      she was. They had done Goodsprings all over again before retiring that
      night. And, sadly, we were to see our very fine old friend laid to rest in
      the Wetmore cemetery within the week. He was fatally injured in a
      horse-and-buggy accident while visiting his daughter, Mrs. Maude Ralston,
      in Holton.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Elwood had told us that he had a message from a miner in
      Goodsprings to deliver to a woman in Wetmore, but he could not remember
      her name. The wife and I put in a portion of the night trying to figure
      out who it might be with a connection out there. The next morning after
      breakfast, I went with Elwood down to the Spectator office. Editor
      Turrentine gave him a personal, with comment, naming the man in
      Goodsprings whose message Elwood would like to deliver, if he could find
      the woman. It brought results. Mrs. Nels Rasmus drove over to Holton the
      day following publication</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">and
      received her message. Mr. Thomas had gone over there to visit his
      daughter. Mrs. Rasmus had lived in the home of P. T. Casey, the Corning
      banker. I believe she was an adopted child. The Good-springs miner was
      connected in some way with one or the other of the two Corning families.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Two years later&#8212;1917&#8212;I chanced to meet this
      man with a stalled Model T Ford near the summit west of Goodsprings, on a
      very slippery road, deep in snow and slush. In the car with me, were Joe
      Walter, Frank and John Williams, and the driver. We were coming down the
      grade, and he had been going up. Recognizing the name on introduction, I
      asked him&#8212;just to be sociable&#8212;what was wrong with his car? He
      answered rather smartly, &#8220;If I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be here.&#8221;
      It was probably a very correct answer</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">but I thought it was no way to dismiss a fellow who had a
      message from Mrs. Rasmus for him.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The deep snows of the past month recall the winters
      back a half century, and more. It seems there was always snow on the
      ground in the winter months then.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the early days, besides making boots and shoes, my
      father, William Bristow, hunted and trapped a good deal, whenever he could
      spare the time from his business. Always one or more of his boys would go
      with him on those outings. We all loved the outdoors&#8212;and with my
      father we were like pals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Among his catches were mink, raccoons, lynx, bobcats,
      and sometimes a catamount. The catamount was an overgrown wildcat between
      the bobcat and the cougar in size. The largest one he ever caught weighed
      sixty-seven pounds. There are none here now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father did not trap for the little fur-bearing,
      stink-throwing skunk, but often one would be found in one of his mink
      traps. Then, from a safe distance, he would shoot the skunk, carefully
      remove it, and deodorize the steel trap by burning before making another
      set.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The time came, though, when my father thought he might
      just as well save the skunk pelts. Skunk fur was in demand at a good
      price, the best skins bringing around four dollars. My father was not
      avaricious. But times were close&#8212;and he had many mouths to feed. And
      four dollars was four dollars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My mother, of course, did not like to have her home
      polluted with skunk essence&#8212;and her boys refused to help with the
      skinning. So, when my father would find a well-marked skunk in one of his
      mink traps he would say, rather sadly, as he tossed it aside, &#8220;That&#8217;s
      four dollars thrown away.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, one Sunday when William Peters was along&#8212;he
      was called Methuselah, or Thuse, for short&#8212;my father found a big
      skunk in one of his traps. It had fine markings. He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
      skin this one, if Thuse will help me.&#8221; Thuse said he didn&#8217;t
      mind; he had trapped and skinned a lot of them without getting stunk up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was a cold day&#8212;ice and snow everywhere. And
      while they skinned that skunk my brother Charley and I built a roaring
      fire with the scaley bark ripped off standing shell-bark hickory trees,
      and some fallen dead tree limbs picked out of the deep snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When they had finished skinning the skunk my father
      walked over to the fire and threw the carcass into the flames. He and
      Thuse then went over to an open spring that came out from under the roots
      of a big elm tree on the Theodore Wolfley farm west of town, and washed
      their hands. They had returned to the fire and were bending over the blaze
      drying their hands, when my father said, &#8220;So you boys think you&#8217;re
      too nice to help your old daddy skin a skunk.&#8221; He laughed.
      Methuselah chuckled. Then, spreading his hands with a sort of satisfied
      air, my father said, &#8220;It&#8217;s as easy as falling off a log when
      you know how.&#8221; Thuse chuckled again, and said, &#8220;Pshaw&#8212;of
      course it is!&#8221; And then, as if giving instructions for his sons to
      note, my father went on, &#8220;I shot him in the head before he had time
      to kick up a stink and of course we were careful not to cut into the
      stink-sack.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley said, &#8220;Smart guys&#8212;you two.&#8221;
      Father gave him a withering look, but said nothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Thus chagrined, Charley and I started away to gather
      some more fuel. Then there was a sharp pop&#8212;a sort of explosion, as
      it were&#8212;in the fire. We looked around into an atmosphere suddenly
      made blue with sickening fumes and sulphurous words of condemnation. We
      saw Pop clawing frantically at his whiskers&#8212;he wore a full beard
      then&#8212;and the two Willies were dancing around the fire like Comanche
      Indians.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was all so sudden. That darned skunk carcass, as if
      in a last noble effort of defense, had exploded and the contents of that
      carefully handled stink-sack was hurled at those two self-assured
      skinners, with my father&#8217;s whiskers as the central target for some
      of the solids. Pugh! It was awful!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Adopting Indian lingo, Charley laughed, &#8220;Heap
      brave skunk-skinners!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Father said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the way you
      said that, young man. One more crack out of you&#8212;and I&#8217;ll tan
      your hide.&#8221; But he wouldn&#8217;t have done that. Charley was a
      model of perfection, and no one appreciated that fact more than did his
      daddy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, have a look at Thuse. A weazened little wisp of a
      man in his twenties&#8212;wrinkled, uncouth, slouched in his clothes
      always much too big for him, he looked as if he had already lived a goodly
      portion of the long span of years accredited to the ancient Methuselah.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On the way home, Methuselah, speaking to my father,
      said, &#8220;They&#8217;ll want to run us out of town, Bill, when we get
      back to Wetmore.&#8221; My father said he could bury his clothes, but
      still he was greatly worried about his whiskers. And, naturally, he was
      thinking about my mother, too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley said, soothingly, &#8220;Oh, just go on home
      Dad, and play her Money Musk, and everything will be fine. Money talks,
      you know. You&#8217;ve got as good as four dollars in your game sack, and
      God only knows how much musk, if you want to call it that, you and Thuse
      have got on your own hides.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My father played the fiddle, and while &#8220;Over the
      Ocean Waves&#8221; was his favorite, he played equally well another tune
      called &#8220;Money Musk.&#8221; He would entertain his family in the home
      of evenings with his old-time fiddling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We reached home about dusk, purposely timed. My father
      and Thuse were both increasingly worried. Thinking that it might be more
      satisfactory to let father face his problem alone, or with only Thuse
      present&#8212;and for other reasons&#8212;Charley and I went out to the
      woodpile and stalled around a bit. Old Piute and Queenie came out of the
      doghouse to greet us. Father never took the dogs along when running his
      trap line.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My mother came to the door and called in her gentle,
      sweet voice&#8212;she was always gentle and sweet with her boys&#8212;&#8221;Come
      on in here, you little stinkers, and get your suppers!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">My father was not at the festive board that Sunday night.
      He was nowhere about the house, that we could see</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and we ate our supper in comparative silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Occasionally, my mother would sniff at us, but she
      offered no protest. Doubtless her two darling boys carried more than a
      suspicion of the polecat&#8217;s pollution, but, having just had a whiff
      of those two Willies, her keen nose was unable to separate the real from
      the imaginary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was almost two hours later when father came home.
      Methuselah was with him. They were both appreciably slicked up&#8212;but
      not really so good. Father was, more or less, shorn of his beard, and
      looked &#8220;funnier&#8221; than his boys had ever before seen him. And,
      would you believe it, the first thing he did was to pick up his fiddle and
      play Money Musk. I looked at my mother&#8212;then turned to Charley,
      giggled, and whispered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s going to
      work.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley giggled, too, and said out loud, &#8220;I
      betcha I could name some slick skunk-skinners who are maybe going to have
      to sleep out in the doghouse tonight.&#8221;</span>
    </p>

      a hitherto wordless dead-pan expression, my mother said, &#8220;You tell

      <span class="c2 c0">I have been asked to &#8220;write up&#8221; the
      Kickapoo Indians. This I cannot do satisfactorily without more data. I do
      not know the history of the tribe and, at this late date, I do not choose
      to waste time in acquainting myself with the particulars. It takes a lot
      of research to do a story of that nature. And, historically written, it
      would be rather drab. Anyway, this is a hurry-up assignment I am writing

    <p class="c1 c5"></p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c13 c6 c0">I have just received the Diamond Jubilee number of
      the Seneca Courier-Tribune, and among other feature articles read your
      article on &#8220;Green Campbell.&#8221; I want to congratulate you on
      this product of your able pen. It presents the theme in a fascinating,
      interesting manner; and incidentally garnishes the subject with a lot of
      worthwhile pioneer history.</span>

    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c6 c0">It is too bad that persons with your ability to write&#8212;to

      class="c6 c0">with words from an apt, concise, and well-stocked

      now, with the passing of years become literary gems. So keep on writing,
      Mr. Bristow; we love the articles of your able mind and eloquent pen.</span>

    <p class="c1 c5"></p>

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">I don&#8217;t believe you have ever written up the
      Kickapoo Indians&#8212;right at your door? Why not reconsider&#8212;and do
      it now?</span>

      <span class="c13 c6 c0">John G. Ellenbecher.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Mr. Ellenbecher has been writing historic articles for
      many years&#8212;principally about the old Overland Trail. In company with
      Abe Eley, formerly of Wetmore, Mr. Ellenbecker called on me when I was
      writing the Green Campbell story. I told them that it would be my last.
      But it was not. I reconsidered. Twelve of the stories in this book have
      been written since. And I may write still another one.&#8212;J. T. B.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">However, there are some incidents having Indian
      connections which might make fairly readable matter. The Kickapoos were, I
      judge, just like other Indians</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">pushed out of civilization to make room for the whites. They
      had come here before the white settlement, of course. Where they came from
      I do not know&#8212;Michigan, maybe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Kickapoos did not war with other tribes. Nor did
      they molest the whites. Still, they were Indians, and it was hard for the
      early settlers to believe that they would have a lasting record as such&#8212;since
      hostile Indians roamed the country west of the Blue river. Back in the
      early 90&#8217;s when the Kickapoos took up the Sioux &#8220;Ghost Dance,
      or Messiah Craze,&#8221; as it was called, and held all-night pow-wows for
      several weeks, there was some nervousness among the whites.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the early 70&#8217;s the Kickapoos came to Wetmore
      to do their trading. They had Government money and were good customers of
      the two general stores. Later they did their trading at Netawaka, and
      still later at Horton. My father, a shoemaker, came to know some of them
      rather intimately. I knew many of them too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Masquequah was Chief then. Many are the times I have
      sold him white sugar and red calico&#8212;the Indians would not buy brown
      sugar if they could get white sugar. This was when I was a clerk in Than
      Morris&#8217; store. Associated with me then were Curt Shuemaker, George
      Cawood and &#8220;Chuck&#8221; Cawood. In the good old days we often piled
      up a thousand dollar sales of a Saturday.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I should, perhaps, amplify this assertion about the
      sugar. We sold at that time about four times as much brown sugar which
      came in barrels marked &#8220;C&#8221; sugar, as we did white sugar. One
      day the boss said, &#8220;The town&#8217;s full of Indians; sell no white
      sugar to anyone until after the Indians leave.&#8221; When I told the
      Chief we had no white sugar, he said, &#8220;Ugh, Indian&#8217;s money
      good as white man&#8217;s money&#8212;maybe. Indians go Netawaka buy white
      sugar.&#8221; And that is what they did. Sorry, I can&#8217;t tell you why
      Morris did not want to sell the Indians white sugar that day. It could
      hardly have been because it consumed more time-it was a busy Saturday&#8212;to
      &#8220;tie-up&#8221; white sugar. We had no paper sacks then. The system
      was to weigh-up the sugar, lay a piece of wrapping paper flat down on the
      counter, empty the sugar onto it; then tie it up&#8212;if you could. A
      green clerk like myself could waste a lot of time trying to wrap up a
      dollar&#8217;s worth of granulated sugar. Brown sugar would pack together,
      and wrap more easily.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The story got out that the Netawaka merchant would
      sell the Indian a bill of groceries, put it in a box, and a clerk would
      obligingly carry it to the Indian&#8217;s wagon&#8212;and then, while the
      Indian was loitering in the store, the clerk would slip out and rob the
      box, in the interest of the merchant. But, if this were true, the Indians
      seemed to like it. They followed the Netawaka merchant to Horton when that
      town got started in 1886. Also, it was said, a certain white farmer living
      near the southwest corner of the reservation, would sometimes ride out
      from Netawaka with one of his Indian friends, letting his hired hand
      follow up with his own rig. At opportune times, the white man would reach
      back and throw out packages for the hired hand to gather up. Methinks Sam
      would have had hard luck in fishing out a package of granulated sugar such
      as those tied-up by me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The old, old Indians are, I believe, all dead now. Of
      the younger generations, I know little&#8212;except that they are the
      descendants of a once relatively large tribe, and that their once large
      domain has been reduced to thirty sections, and that much of the land
      within the boundaries of the reservation is now owned by white people.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">H. A. Hogard, Educational Field Agent, and Grover
      Allen, Indian, were in Wetmore last Sunday practicing archery with George
      Grubb and Ollie Woodman. They told me the Indian population now numbers
      about 280. There are about fifty families.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">For my first episode I shall tell you about a
      deer-hunt my father and I had with the Indians. In a former article I told
      you about an Indian with a party of deer-hunters we chanced to meet in the
      John Wolfley timber, whom my father named Eagle Eye. His Indian name was
      far from that, however.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was Eagle Eye who had arranged this hunt. He
      brought along from the reservation, eight miles northeast of here, two
      extra ponies&#8212;one of normal size and not too large at that, and a
      little one for me to ride. While putting the saddle on the little pony my
      father asked the Indians if it were a gentle pony. Eagle Eye said, &#8220;Him
      heap gentle like lazy squaw.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It had snowed during the night and was still snowing
      when the Indians arrived at day-break. Two deer-runs were to be covered
      and it would take a full day to do it. Then, too, our party wanted to, if
      possible, get onto the grounds ahead of other hunters. It was not very
      cold, and my father was pleased with the snow. Tracking would be good. A
      natural born hunter, snow always appealed to him. He had killed a great
      many deer in his native Tennessee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the old days in Tennessee there was hardly ever
      enough snow to do a good job of tracking. However, hunters down there this
      winter would have had snow aplenty to track deer&#8212;if deer still
      remain to be tracked. A foot of snow and thirteen degrees below zero was
      recorded January 19th at Nashville&#8212;where I was born, the second son
      of a tanner, at 11:30 p. m., December 31, 1861.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also in our hunting party, riding a small pony, was a
      little Indian boy whom they called&#8212;shall I say&#8212;Nish-a-shin.
      This might not be correct. When we got lined out, Eagle Eye rode first,
      then my father. I was third in line and Nish-a-shin was fourth. Three
      Indians followed in single-file formation with long rifles carried
      crosswise in front of them. The Indians all rode bareback, even
      Nish-a-shin. My father had secured two saddles for us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the gray of that early Sunday morning after the
      storm abated and the white prairie lay still, Eagle Eye headed west toward
      the John Wolfley timber. We traveled in silence, never out of a walk. From
      the head of Spring creek we went across to Elk creek and Soldier creek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At that time the whole southwest country was
      practically virgin prairie. The Dixon 40-acres where Maurice Savage now
      lives, and the Bill Rudy land where Joe Pfrang&#8217;s home now is, were
      the only fenced tracts in that section of the country. Bill Rudy went to
      California. Years later when my father went out there they renewed their
      friendship. And one time when I was visiting in Fresno my father took me
      to see Mr. Rudy. He owned an 80-acre ranch and seemed to be well pleased
      with the change he had made. He had much to say about the intense cold
      weather he had endured on his homestead here. The winters Mr. Rudy
      experienced in Kansas were very much like the one we are now having, only
      in the old days real blizzards were the rule.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">On October seventeenth, 1898, Jack Hayden lost nineteen
      head of cattle, in a pasture north of the Rudy</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">or Pfrang</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">place,
      in an unusually early and unusually severe blizzard. The cattle drifted
      with the blinding snow-storm over a bank and piled up in a ditch. I was in
      Chicago at the time. It rained in Chicago, but coming home on the
      Burlington, the first snow appeared near the north line of Missouri, got
      heavier toward Atchison, and from Atchison west on the Central Branch, it
      was really heavy. That snow, and succeeding falls, kept the ground here
      covered in a sea of white until spring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Those Indians called me &#8220;paleface papoose.&#8221;
      I was, of course, beyond the normal age of a papoose, but your old Indian
      was no fool. They probably reasoned that whiteman would not understand
      Indian&#8217;s word for youth. Eagle Eye had started calling me &#8220;paleface
      papoose&#8221; when my father was saddling the pony. Maybe it was because
      I had to have a saddle. Little Nish-a-shin you know rode bareback. He did
      not make much talk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was in the wilds of Soldier creek, in the big
      timber, where we made camp for dinner. One of the Indians carried a
      stew-kettle in a grain-sack and I carried a flour-sack having in it
      several loaves of bread baked by my mother, and maybe four or five links
      of butcher-shop bologna. Also two tin-cups, two tin-plates, with knives
      and forks for two. My mother did not think to put in spoons, but then of
      course she could not know the kind of mess we were in for.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With fallen deadwood dug up out of the snow a rousing
      fire was made&#8212;and the kettle put on. When the Indian dish
      corresponding to the whiteman&#8217;s mulligan was ready, all hands
      squatted down around the fire and devoured the food ravenishly, including
      my mother&#8217;s nice brown loaves of bread and the store bologna. My
      father had told me that I would be expected to eat of the Indian&#8217;s
      food and that I should pass our bread and meat around, as a token of
      friendship.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">I cannot say now what kind of meat it was those Indians
      cooked in that kettle, but it was something which they had brought along.
      They had not killed anything on the hunt that day. However, I do not
      believe it was dogmeat. Surely Eagle Eye would not have done that to us.
      But maybe it was just as well that I didn&#8217;t then know anything about
      the accredited habits of Indians in general as with respect to their dogs.
      I can however truthfully say this much for the Indian&#8217;s stew. That
      dish&#8212;dog or no dog&#8212;didn&#8217;t gag me nearly so much as the
      bowl of Chinese noodles my father and my brother Frank cajoled me into
      eating with them and other members of their party</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c0">Harry Maxwell, a former Wetmore boy, and Dan Conner</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">while seeing Fresno&#8217;s
      Chinatown.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">After traveling all day through the woods, following
      cow-paths and never deviating once from the single-file formation which
      characterized the start on that white morning away back in the 70&#8217;s
      we got back home at dusk. From sun-up until sun-down we had traveled, and
      not one deer did we see. Some tracks in the fresh snow were followed for
      miles. Only once did the Indians dismount and hunt a clump of woods
      hurriedly on foot, spreading out fanwise. They had glimpsed something
      moving among the trees&#8212;something which they did not locate. It was
      then I learned why they had brought the incommunicative Nish-a-shin along.
      Quickly he began gathering up the reins of the deserted ponies. I learned
      something else too. Pronto paleface papoose became a second edition of
      Nish-a-shin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Starting up near Goff, the Spring creek deer-run came
      down to within a half mile of Wetmore, then went southeast across the
      prairie to Mosquito creek, thence up Mosquito creek nearly to Bancroft and
      across the prairie again to the head of Spring creek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Three deer were the most ever seen at one time on this
      run. They came into a flock of 4,000 sheep I was herding for old Morgan on
      the Dan Williams place a mile south of town, where Clyde Ely now lives.
      The sheep were frightened and divided themselves into two bunches as the
      deer loped gaily through the flock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">If you don&#8217;t know, a deer-run is the feeding
      grounds of those ruminants. As long as the deer remain in the country they
      travel the same route closely. In the winter&#8212;in the old days here&#8212;they
      fed largely on hazel-brush and Other tender twigs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We observed in our early hunts that the deer when
      feeding always traveled the circle in the same way, never reversing.
      Sometimes however when routed suddenly they would backtrack. And when
      pressed they would usually run with the wind. Probably that was not so
      much to gain speed as it was to camouflage the trail of their own scent
      and to more readily themselves catch the scent of their pursuers. When
      hard pressed they would sometimes take off with the wind and go ten or
      twelve miles off the run&#8212;in one instance, nearly to Sabetha.
      Whenever a deer would turn tail to wind we were ready to go home. I have
      seen them break out against the wind and then when off a reasonable
      distance circle around and go the other way. At such times my father would
      say, &#8220;Ah damn it, now he&#8217;s gone with the wind!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Since I am employing a rather broad drag-line brand of
      technique, there is one more thing I might amplify here. In the beginning
      I said it would entail a lot of research to do a good Indian story,
      historically complete. Reliable information is hard to obtain. The old
      Indians&#8212;the Indians I knew&#8212;have all gone to their &#8220;happy
      hunting grounds.&#8221; The present generation does not seem to have a
      very clear picture of the old days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">For instance, I made two trips to the reservation about
      five years ago and interviewed a number of the older ones</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">second generation, of course&#8212;in a vain effort to
      obtain just one Indian word. You may recall that the tanyard story was, I
      might say, predicated on the Indian&#8217;s name of sumac. When a small
      boy, I had understood Eagle Eye to call it &#8220;sequaw.&#8221; I wanted
      to be accurate, as that flaming little bush played an important part in
      the story as well as in the tannery. Not one of them could tell me the
      Indian name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I found one Indian, Henry Rhodd, 64 years old at that
      time, who said he could not tell me the Indian name for sumac, but he knew
      what their fathers used it for. He said they tanned their deer skins with
      it. That was the same thing Eagle Eye had so dexterously managed to convey
      to my father and me up in the Wolfley timber sixty-odd years earlier.
      Henry, whom I would judge carries a mite of French blood in his veins,
      sniffed as if he were inhaling the perfume of a fragrant rose, and said,
      &#8220;And oh it smelled so good.&#8221; This, however, did not coincide
      with my findings as a tanner&#8217;s helper. Still, I have seen my father
      sniff his newly tanned calf skins and say the same thing. Our tan-yard was
      just about the &#8220;stinkenist&#8221; place on earth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In this connection I might mention that some years
      later I, myself, shot a deer on lower Mosquito creek. My brother Sam and I
      had started out one afternoon, the two of us riding our old roan mare,
      Pet. We struck a fresh trail south of town about where the three deer and
      the four thousand sheep had mixed. We followed the tracks to the Frank
      Purcell timber. There we ran onto John Dixon and &#8220;Dore&#8221;
      Thornton. They said they had been trailing the deer on foot all day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">John Dixon told me to go around to the south side of
      the timber; that they would follow the tracks through the woods. The deer
      came out running fast, and I shot it. The charge of buckshot from my
      muzzle-loading shotgun hit a little too far back to make a clean kill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We trailed that crippled deer&#8212;it was shot
      through the body as evidenced by blood on either side of the trail&#8212;for
      a distance of ten miles to the very spot where it had been started in the
      morning. At the line between the John Wolfley place and the Mary Morris
      place, now owned by R. M. Emery, the following morning, we lost the trail
      because of melting snow and cattle tracks. The deer was found dead a few
      days later only a quarter of a mile away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">After it had been shot that deer laid down three times</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">at the Joe Boyce place, at the
      Bill Rudy place, and on the commons where the Ben Walters place is now.
      The first time it laid down the warm blood from the wound bored a hole in
      the snow. Darkness caught us at the old Dixon or Savage place. It was then
      we remembered the old roan mare was still tied back in the Purcell timber.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">What boy is there who would not have been proud of
      that feat of marksmanship&#8212;plugging his first deer through and
      through as it ran past at almost lightning speed in its mad flight for
      life? Did I glory in the feat? I did. At first. As a big-game hunter I
      had, in my own estimation, scored high. Following in the footsteps of my
      father, a born hunter of big game, I had all but arrived. Plugged my first
      deer! I was the &#8220;toast&#8221; of the town! Or at least I could
      imagine I was. It would still be interesting to know just what would have
      happened had I brought home the venison. But I cannot now begin to tell
      you how adversely I was moved when the deer was found dead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In a flash I saw it all&#8212;how I had dropped back
      into a crook of the old worm fence on the Roger O&#8217;Mera farm and
      waited for the deer, driven out of the Purcell timber by the three other
      hunters, to come within gunshot; how, as if it had wings, the deer, after
      being shot, cleared that high rail fence; and how its life-blood spurting
      two ways stained the fresh white snow where the little animal lit on the
      opposite side of the rails; how every few miles we saw it jump up from a
      brief rest and run on again, leaving more red on the white; and how, as we
      discovered the next morning after leaving the trail at dusk, that a wolf
      had taken up the chase and had sent the tired deer on and on without more
      rest back to the big timber from whence it had come and where, perhaps, in
      the throes of great agony, it sought its mate. And how, still pursued by
      the wolf, it had cleared in one great leap&#8212;its last grand leap&#8212;on
      a down-hill slope, a thirty foot hazel thicket.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Something indefinable, something unforgettable, made
      an impression on me then. And that something put the &#8220;kibosh&#8221;
      on my big-game hunting aspirations. I do not now count it a weakness.
      Though there were no game laws then, that crime was made all the worse
      because it was a doe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">My brother Sam, who rode with me that day, later,
      really brought home the venison, eclipsing all my past glory. But it took
      two trips all the way to Arkansas in a horse-drawn covered wagon to do it.
      The first and unsuccessful time he had for hunting companions Alex
      McCreery, John E. Thomas, and my father. Their bag was a few wild turkeys.
      The second trip Sam made with Roy Shumaker. This time they killed two
      deer. Then, for the first time, the sons whose father was a veteran
      deer-hunter, were to know the taste of venison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, I used to chase wolves and jack rabbits with my
      horse and the hounds, and enjoy it&#8212;until one particular rabbit chase
      which spoiled the &#8220;sport&#8221; for me. It was on a Sunday afternoon
      in the quarter section adjoining town on the northeast&#8212;the south
      half of which is now owned by-Bill Davis. No horses were in this chase.
      The crowd from town, with several trucks, were stationed on the ridge near
      the southwest corner. The gray hounds started the rabbit over near the
      east line, and it ran north down a draw, out of sight. It swung to the
      left and topped the ridge north of the crowd, with the dogs in close
      pursuit. The rabbit turned south heading straight for the crowd, and
      jumped up into Frank Ducker&#8217;s truck, right at my feet. One of the
      men standing in the truck grabbed it while the dogs were on both sides of
      the truck. The rabbit squealed pitifully. The captor said its sides were
      thumping like a trip-hammer. Most of the men thought the rabbit had earned
      its freedom&#8212;but not so with some of the &#8220;sports.&#8221;
      Expecting to see another chase, they dropped the rabbit on the ground
      about two rods in front of the dogs, but when the rabbit saw the dogs it
      began squealing again&#8212;and the grayhounds rushed in and nabbed both
      rabbit and squeal before it realized that it must run again for its life.
      Every time after this when a rabbit chase was proposed, I could hear that
      frightened jack rabbit&#8217;s pitiful squeal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But I never experienced any sickening wolf chases.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">We had grayhounds and trail hounds under foot when we
      lived on the Hazeltine farm&#8212;but not one that I could call my own. I
      bought a yellow half-breed grayhound named Tuck from a farm hand on the
      Zeke Jennings place for one dollar, that proved to be a wonder. The
      unknown half of him was supposed to be bull dog. With Alex McCreery and
      his pack of trail hounds, and a half dozen other horseback riders and some
      grayhounds, a wolf was started out of an isolated clump of brush on the
      south end of the Len Jones farm, two miles west of Wetmore. I happened to
      be on the east side of the brush patch with my dog, while the other riders
      with the pack were on the west side. The wolf came out about a rod in
      front of my position, and Tuck got an almost even start in the chase. I
      had a pretty fast horse, but the chase led across a slough, and I lost
      some ground in heading this wash&#8212;but even so, I was on hand soon
      after the kill, one mile from the start, before Alex and the other riders
      and the dogs arrived. Alex said, &#8220;You and old Tuck was
      to-hell-and-gone before we caught sight of you.&#8221; Tuck had caught the
      wolf&#8212;and drowned it in an eighteen-inch pool of water, along the
      branch. I found him sitting on his tail at the edge of the pool&#8212;looking
      very pleased. In those days it was a boy&#8217;s greatest ambition to own
      a fast horse, and a fast dog. Now I had both. The only flaw was that I was
      no longer a boy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Tuck also caught a deer in the big bottom south of
      spring creek on the Mary Morris farm four miles west of Wetmore. In this
      chase I was trailing pretty close, on my horse, when the dog grabbed the
      deer&#8217;s hind leg, causing both to tumble end-over-end. In the midst
      of this spill, it seemed to me as if deer and yellow dogs were scattered
      all over the ground. The deer got up first, and ran west toward the John
      Wolfley timber. My prized hound did not seem to have the heart to follow
      after it. I think there were moments now when Tuck did not know east from
      west.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, a last word about the Indians&#8212;and the Ghost
      Dance or Messiah Craze as participated in by the Kickapoos. The &#8220;craze&#8221;
      was a sort of spiritual delusion starting with the Sioux Indians, the same
      blood-thirsty red devils who got credit for the ghastly Custer massacre in
      1876. This, and other depredations, were still fresh in the minds of the
      people, and there was widespread alarm among the citizens whenever the
      craze had taken hold. However, the craze was short-lived. I do not think
      the Kickapoos repeated after the first year. The dance that time at the
      Mission was kept going for three weeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I do not recall in what way this dance differed from
      the Green Corn Dance held annually by the Kickapoos, or other tribal
      dances. But undoubtedly it carried a threat to the whites. Except for
      brandishing tomahawks at certain periods of the dance&#8212;it looked to
      the casual observer like other Indian dances. Old Sitting Bull, of the
      Sioux, had made much bad medicine, and the threat was in the air, if not
      actually in the dance. Gold had been discovered earlier in the Black Hills
      country. The Government had withdrawn a part of the Indian lands for
      development by the whites. This the Sioux resented. There was fear among
      the Indians in general that their lands might be taken away from them. I
      cannot now be sure of this, but I believe the Government took a hand in
      suppressing the Ghost Dance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I can best explain things with a reprint of what I
      wrote for the Spectator at the time. Incidentally, I might say that in
      looking up the old files I observe now that this story appeared in the
      first issue of The Spectator after I became its owner. Also, that the
      article was illustrated with a splendid woodcut engraved by my brother
      Sam. Illustrations in that day were engraved on cross-grain box-wood
      blocks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The following excerpt is copied from the issue of
      December 12, 1890: During the past week or ten days, our people have
      visited the Indian Mission, eight miles northwest of Wetmore to witness
      the Indian pow-wow which has been in progress for several weeks. Although
      a more civilized tribe than the Sioux with which the &#8220;Ghost Dance&#8221;
      originated, the Kickapoos have caught the &#8220;Messiah Craze&#8221; and
      have made things lively for a while. The dance has been watched with
      considerable interest and no little alarm by many visitors and citizens
      living near the reservation. However, the conclusion now is that there
      will be no outbreak. The neighbors along the line look upon their actions
      merely as a curious freak of superstition.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When asked how long the Indians kept up the dance, an
      old Indian who was too feeble to participate in the festivities, in broken
      English, said, &#8220;Messiah come at sunrise.&#8221; It was afterwards
      learned that the Indians continued dancing all night with the expectation
      of seeing Christ, or the Messiah, at sunrise. This is, in a manner,
      following the custom of the ancient Aztec sun-worshipers of Mexico, who
      years ago builded mounds, some of them 600 and 800 feet high, where they
      would assemble at sunrise and carry on their festivities in the
      anticipation of the coming of some great divinity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Two Sioux Indians got an inspiration from on High&#8212;or
      elsewhere. It was only a dream, of course&#8212;but then why should not
      the Indian be allowed to dream as well as the white man? He has proven his
      capability, and has gone the present generation of white men one better.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">A careful study of ancient recorded stories shows this
      one to be no more fantastic than the feat accredited to Moses, who, with
      an outstretched hand caused the waters of the Red Sea to part so that the
      Children of Israel might walk across on dry land. But, I believe, Moses
      credited the Lord</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">collaborating
      no doubt&#8212;with making the big wind which actually drove the water out
      of their path. Our Kickapoos were not much on the big blow&#8212;but it
      seems that a couple of Sioux, in this instance, made a heap lot of big
      wind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">According to a recent writer on the subject, the
      Messiah craze is the out-growth of a startling story related by two Sioux
      Indians, which, in substance, lays bare the assertion that Jesus had come
      down upon earth again and had appeared to the Indians. According to the
      report He was discovered by two Indians who had followed a light in the
      sky for 18 days over a country destitute of water. The most peculiar part
      of the story is that at each camping place they were supplied with water
      from a little pool that came up out of the ground and furnished just
      enough for their needs and no more. At the end of the 18 days journey they
      came to a secluded place near a mountain, and there they found a hut,
      built of bull-rushes, and on entering they saw Jesus, who told them that
      He had come once to save the white men and they had crucified Him&#8212;and
      this time He had appeared to the Indians and that they should go back and
      bear the news to the other Indians. The two Indians were then borne up in
      a cloud and in a very short time were set down at their home where they
      related what they had seen.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">My father had bought a coon-dog from a traveler. This
      night&#8212;Christmas Eve&#8212;was to have been the try-out but the way
      it turned out, Dad could not know then how badly he had been &#8220;skinned.&#8221;
      That came later. Old Drum had a wonderful voice, and though he &#8220;lied&#8221;
      a few times on later occasions, he never did tree a coon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the party were Roland Van Amburg, Bill (Thuse)
      Peters, Jim Scanlan, Bob Graham, my father and myself. Incidentally, Van
      Amburg was the last man to take up a homestead in these parts. He
      homesteaded the 80 acres now owned by Ambrose McConwell, almost adjoining
      town, in the middle 70&#8217;s. He was a happy-go-lucky, clownish sort of
      man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Well, Van was not exactly the last one to file on a
      homestead here, but he was the last one to do it in the regular way.
      Lawyer F. M. Jefferies, while publishing the Spectator in Wetmore in the
      80&#8217;s filed on a quarter a few miles northwest of town&#8212;but it
      developed that the land was improved and occupied by Eli Swerdfeger, who
      had by mistake filed on another number. When Eli&#8217;s neighbor
      threatened to do mayhem to Lawyer Jefferies, he relinquished</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and Swerdfeger&#8217;s correct filing was even later
      than Van&#8217;s. They called it &#8220;claim jumping&#8221;&#8212;though
      it was hardly that, in the true sense of the term. There had, however,
      been some claim jumping earlier, where settlers were negligent in
      fulfilling the lawful requirements. A claim jumper in the old days was
      held in about the same degree of contempt as is now the &#8220;scab&#8221;
      workman in a unionized community.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">With team and wagon and dog, we reached the timber
      about dusk, barely ahead of a blizzard. Owing to the storm, the projected
      coon-hunt did not take place. The whole night was spent around a bonfire
      out there in the deep wood. The men talked about going home, but the
      intervening six miles of unbroken prairie would have been hard to
      negotiate with a team on a night like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Fortunately for us, it was not very cold. Disagreeably
      cold, to be sure, but in severity&#8212;low temperature&#8212;it did not
      compare with the blizzard which blew in upon us last Monday (Jan. 18,
      1943) with a temperature of 10 degrees below zero, to be followed the next
      morning with 22 degrees below.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The campfire, built in a sheltered spot, was near a
      tree which had some holes cut in a big limb, old choppings which were
      assumed the work of Indians. Those holes started Thuse Peters to talking.
      In telling of an occurrence alleged to have taken place on the Kickapoo
      reservation, in which he himself had figured rather conspicuously, Thuse
      graciously endowed the mate of the squaw in his story with a fine growth
      of whiskers&#8212;which whiskers, however, the Redskin did not have. Or
      did he? Thuse was a little wild of the mark in some of his statements,
      probably all of them. Bob Graham called him for that one about the Indian&#8217;s
      whiskers. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;you living
      here against the Indian reservation all your life. You should know Indians
      do not have beards.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Well,&#8221; inquired Thuse, glancing toward
      one of the party having heavenly hirsute adornment, &#8220;does an
      Irishman have whiskers?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;What a silly question,&#8221; broke in Roland
      Van Amburg. &#8220;Just take a look at Jim Scanlan over there by the
      tree-trunk. I&#8217;d say an Irishman has whiskers.&#8221; Jim Scanlan was
      section foreman here. There could be no mistaking his nationality.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Said Thuse, &#8220;I just wanted to be sure of that.&#8221;
      He went about replenishing the waning fire. This done, he said, &#8220;That
      Indian was half Irish.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One story led to another, and finally my father told
      of hunting panthers in Tennessee. He said it was claimed by old woodsmen
      that the panther made a noise like the cry of a woman, but he had never
      heard a panther scream, and he didn&#8217;t believe it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Do you suppose, Bill that there ever was a
      panther seen in this country?&#8221; This inquiry was made by Mr. Scanlan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Dad, &#8220;I once tracked a
      varmint that might have been a panther through these very woods.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Van chimed in, &#8220;Did they ever learn what killed
      the farmer&#8217;s stock over on Elk creek? That was believed to have been
      the work of a panther. And what about that varmint on the Rudy place?&#8221;
      Van was, as I knew stating facts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was generally known here that a prowler of some
      kind had killed a calf on the Bill Rudy farm, and had dragged it several
      hundred yards to a hazel thicket&#8212;and after eating its fill, buried
      the remaining carcass under leaves, after the habits of the panther. Bill
      Rudy owned the land where Joe Pfrang now lives.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The storm grew in intensity. It had filled the woods
      with voices. If you turned your imagination loose you could hear a cry, a
      laugh&#8212;anything you chose. Then suddenly, astonishingly, there it
      was. A woman&#8217;s scream. Or was it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Thuse said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Bill&#8217;s panther.&#8221;
      Bill was my Dad. Old Drum raised his voice. He made sound enough, in the
      tree-walled confines of that hunters&#8217; paradise, to raise the dead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Bob Graham said, &#8220;I feel spooky. Think I need a
      bracer.&#8221; He uncorked his bottle and took a good one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, whatever it might have been, that thing had the
      men baffled. Albeit the storm raged fiercely in the tree-tops and upon the
      hillside from whence the sound came, a deadly calm settled around the
      bonfire. The men looked at one another in complete silence for a tense
      moment. I believe everyone was wondering if maybe Thuse had not named it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">By this time everyone was, shall I say,
      panther-conscious. I would not want to say that the men actually were
      waiting in expectancy for the appearance of that killer. You know how it
      is. After a menacing thing has been discussed in your presence for hours,
      without realizing it, you just don&#8217;t forget.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then suddenly, miraculously, there it was again&#8212;something
      very like a woman&#8217;s voice coming in swells above the howl of the
      storm. Van, who had repeatedly urged the men to break up camp and make a
      try for home, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the voice of an angel&#8212;an angel
      come to tell us to get the hell out of here while the going is still
      possible.&#8221; Dad scoffed, &#8220;An angel out here in the woods on a
      night like this&#8212;man, you must be crazy!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Jim Scanlan said, &#8220;Well, anybody who don&#8217;t
      believe in ghosts is maybe going to pretty soon.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">We had along a sharp axe and several good woodchoppers.
      At first fuel for the fire was gleaned from old dead tree tops lying on
      the ground&#8212;tops of blackoaks my father had cut some years before for
      the tanbark to be used in his tannery. But as the snow became deeper, and
      the puzzling voices in the woods persisted, the men&#8212;including yours
      truly</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">somehow did not seem
      to want to venture beyond the circle of light. They fetched fuel from a
      close-in rick of cordwood&#8212;four-foot lengths. Without leave, we
      burned Anna Buzan&#8217;s wood, a full cord, that night. It was wood my
      brother and I had cut on shares. Adjustment could be&#8212;and was&#8212;made
      later.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back there on the ridge high above us, in the thick of
      that blizzard, a woman was singing, as it were, for her life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Let me explain. Three people&#8212;a woman and two men
      enroute to the old English colony, from somewhere farther south, had
      bogged down in the storm two miles from home, and were desperately in need
      of help.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The old road in those days, coming in from the prairie
      lands on the south, followed the ridge approximately on the line between
      the John Wolfley timber on the east and the Anna Buzan timber on the west,
      to a crossing on Spring creek. The road was first used in bringing out
      cross-ties for use in building the railroad which now skirts the woods on
      the north side of the creek. Back on the ridge several old wagon trails
      led into the forest. The team those Colonists were driving, to a
      ramshackle old spring wagon, had wandered off the road and had floundered
      in one of those side leads, upsetting the wagon. This had been the cause
      of that first scream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Having broken harness which they could not repair in
      the dark, they had started on foot to where, in passing, they had seen the
      light of our bonfire, hoping it would lead them to the home of a settler.
      But when close enough to see it was only a bonfire, misgivings began to
      assail them. What if it should prove to be an Indian camp, or maybe
      horse-thieves in hiding? These facts were made known to us after they had
      reached our fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Van&#8217;s &#8220;Angel&#8221; had come in the
      flesh&#8212;her long skirt, held up in front, trailing atop the snow as
      she moved in&#8212;we could see that she was not garbed in the traditional
      folds of flowing gauze-like fabric, as becomes an angel. It would have
      been all out of place on a night like that. As it was, I thought she was
      dressed rather too thinly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Bob Graham said, &#8220;If you wouldn&#8217;t be
      offended, young lady, I&#8217;d offer you a swig of my whisky.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Liquor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can take it,&#8221;
      Bob passed the bottle to her. &#8220;O-oo, so little,&#8221; she
      complained. &#8220;I &#8216;opes it will &#8216;elp.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Their names were Bill and Teddy and Minerva. Bill led
      off as spokesman. He said, &#8220;When we sawer men walking around the
      fire we knew there would be no &#8216;ouse &#8216;ere. And I asked Teddy
      wot shall we do now?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">&#8220;Ted &#8216;e said,&#8221; continued Bill,
      &#8220;Blast me &#8216;ide if I know wot would be best. Wot you think,
      Minerva? Want to chawncit?&#8221; Teddy spoke for Minerva. He said,
      &#8220;Minerva &#8216;ere,&#8221; pointing to the girl, &#8220;said to us&#8212;Now
      you just &#8216;old your &#8216;orses, men I got it. I&#8217;ll sing
      &#8216;em a song.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Let me remind you here that it was their ability and
      their willingness to sing on any and all occasions that made those
      Colonists extremely popular at the country school-house lyceum of that
      age.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Bill talked again. He said, &#8220;Then I said
      Hindians or &#8216;orse-theives, whichever they are, would know that
      &#8216;appy, singing folks bode nobody &#8216;arm.&#8221; For the purpose
      intended, Bill&#8217;s idea was not bad&#8212;but Minerva challenged it
      promptly. She said, &#8220;You can just drop that &#8216;appy part of it,
      Mr. Bill.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Their reasoning was logical. And their manner in
      coping with the situation was unique. For them to have burst in upon a
      band of horse-thieves in those days would, most likely, have been
      suicidal. But with Indians of the times, it is my belief, they would have
      had no trouble at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">When they had thawed out, after Minerva had obliged us
      with more songs&#8212;and believe me, that girl could sing</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">Teddy said he would fetch his concertina from the
      wrecked wagon. It maybe was a good thing he didn&#8217;t know anything
      about all that panther discussion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">However, after Ted had returned, Van, who, as a boy,
      had lived in a panther country back east, told the newcomers about the Elk
      creek incident and other periodical panther scares elaborating on the
      dangers of same. He told those people they could count themselves lucky in
      finding our fire. &#8220;Wild animals,&#8221; he said, &#8220;won&#8217;t
      go near a fire.&#8221; I knew that this was not news to any of our party.
      And I knew, too, we would keep our visitors for the duration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Van started it. When he had guessed the hour of
      midnight had arrived, he yelled so that all could hear above the roar of
      the storm&#8212;&#8221;Merry Christmas!&#8221; Our English visitors
      returned the greeting&#8212;though, enveloped in swirling snow, they didn&#8217;t
      seem to put much heart in it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Looking up toward the high heavens in readiness to speak,
      Dad was caught full in the face with a gob of dislodged snow from the
      treetops. He said, clawing the snow out of his whiskers at the same time,
      &#8220;It didn&#8217;t look like this could happen when we started out
      yesterday afternoon</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c0">it was so
      warm, almost like spring. But then maybe this snow is a godsend.&#8221; He
      clawed again at his whiskers, saying &#8220;Dammit!&#8221; He probably
      would have quoted the old saying, &#8220;A green Christmas presages a fat
      graveyard&#8221;</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">but old
      Drum raised his voice again, bringing everyone to rigid attention. The dog
      ran out a few paces, turned around and came back. He had not gone beyond
      the circle of light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Together, or rather alternately, Minerva and Teddy
      made music against the howl of the storm until morning. They could not
      team together. This nightingale who had come to us out of the storm, was
      from another colony&#8212;perhaps English Ridge, south of Havensville.
      Bill sang some, in a comical way. Our improvised shelter, hardly worth
      mentioning, and our fire had kept them from freezing. They were grateful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">They were of the old English Colony folk&#8212;Bill and
      Ted. This is not to say they were scions of the favored six families who
      occupied Llewellyn Castle on section 25, in Harrison township. They might
      have been from any one&#8212;or two</span> <span>&#8212;</span> <span
      class="c2 c0">of the dugouts scattered about over the prairies outside the
      Colony-owned section. But they were decidedly English, and none the less
      Colonists.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When at last morning had come, and we had seen our
      visitors off, we drove out onto a vast prairie covered with snow, homeward
      bound. We would be doing well if we reached home in time for dinner. Deep
      drifts lay ahead of us and there was a sea of white on all sides as far as
      one could look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Incidentally, I might say here that the streets in
      Wetmore were completely blocked by that storm. The main street in the
      business section was drifted so deeply in snow that to facilitate traffic
      a cut was made down the center of the street, and one standing up in a
      wagon had to look up to see the top of the cut.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Van stroked old Drum&#8217;s head. He said, &#8220;Too
      bad, old boy, you didn&#8217;t get a chance to show Bill how good you are.
      Skunked this time, but maybe better luck next time. Wish you could tell us
      what kind of a varmint you saw, heard, or scented, when you made all that
      commotion back there. You wouldn&#8217;t lie to a fellow, old longears,
      and you are not afraid of the dark&#8212;are you?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dad said, in a tone that indicated his great
      disappointment over the bogged down coon-hunt, with maybe, also apologies
      to his guests, &#8220;Well, damn it, men&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t a complete
      waterhaul. We&#8217;ve got a white Christmas.&#8221;</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">March 5, 1943</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c14 c12 c0">By John T. Bristow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">The hunt was staged in Uncle Nick Bristow&#8217;s timber</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">way back in the 70&#8217;s. It
      was on the home place over on the Rose branch, the farm now owned by Bill
      Mast. The trail of the hunters would range down stream, overlapping into
      the Jim Hyde and Bill Rose woods, and on down to the junction with Wolfley
      creek. Ostensibly, it was to have been a coon-hunt, but it soon developed
      into something bigger and better. &#8216;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">There was a good moon&#8212;but to attract the hunters, a
      big bonfire was built in the woods, and the men flocked in from all
      directions. The interesting part of it was that three of them were from
      the old English Colony, two miles west of my uncle&#8217;s farm</span>
      <span>&#8212;</span> <span class="c2 c0">&#8221;Green Englishmen,&#8221;
      the Wolfley creekers said they were. Couldn&#8217;t name them now&#8212;and
      be sure. One of them was a stocky little man, very talkative, very
      agreeable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then there were the Porters, the Pickets, the Piatts,
      the Snows, the Mayers, the Barnes boys, and others&#8212;not aiming to
      overlook my Uncle Nick and his son, Burrel. The elder Mayers, Gus and
      Noah, were Pennsylvania Dutch, with Holland ancestry. Gus liked his fun
      while Noah liked to stay at home and mind his own business. But some of
      Noah&#8217;s boys were in the gathering, as was also Peter Metzdorf, who
      had a while back married Gus Mayer&#8217;s daughter, Anna. Peter was
      German&#8212;the real thing. He lived in Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Of the five Porter brothers, Ambrose was the only one
      that I can now positively say was present. But John and Tom and their
      brothers-in-law, Bill Evans and Ben Summers, were probably around
      somewhere. Bill Porter had just married my Aunt Nancy, late of Tennessee,
      and he couldn&#8217;t come. And Ben Porter&#8212;well, they said he was
      too contrary to appreciate a good thing like this. Ambrose wore his red
      hair&#8212;it was really red&#8212;at shoulder length. He wore gold
      earrings, too, and three gutta-percha rings on one finger, rings he
      himself had made from old coat buttons.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It was good to have Roland Van Amburg with us. Roland
      was a grand old sport. Moreover, Roland Van Amburg had much in common with
      my Uncle Nick Bristow. They had both suffered, or were due to suffer,
      heavy losses in large herds of Texas cattle they had bought from Dr. W. L.
      Challis, of Atchison. It is barely possible that those cattle might have
      been milling about on the western part of Uncle Nick&#8217;s farm that
      night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The bonfire was built on the edge of a small clearing,
      with a large tree backed up by a clump of small growth on the right. In
      the distance&#8212;not too distant&#8212;was a big log lying on the edge
      of a ravine, with a 10-foot bank at this point. A small tree with good
      height stood at the top end of the log on the left side of the clearing.
      One approaching from the north would see the log only after advancing so
      far, and even then only if not otherwise attracted. Had it been a plant
      for a modern movie scene it could not have been a more perfect setting for
      the thing that actually happened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While yet around the bonfire the talk turned to
      panthers. One had reportedly been seen, or heard, in the woods a couple of
      miles away&#8212;up in the Rube Wolfley neighborhood. The men would be
      careful not to hunt that timber because they didn&#8217;t want their dogs
      to be torn to pieces. Uncle Nick owned a timber lot over in the panther
      country.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The natives saw in this hunt a chance to have some fun
      at the expense of the Englishmen. Also, they wanted to impress those
      Colonists in a way that might be the means of keeping them on their own
      reservation, so to speak. A lot of timber-stealing had been going on and
      the Colonists were suspicioned. As a matter of fact, timber-stealing in
      those days was widespread. But in that business the Colonists were no
      worse than the natives, but the Colonists were always sure to get the
      blame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While people generally scoffed at the idea of panthers
      roaming the woods, there were some who said it was not altogether
      improbable&#8212;that one might have escaped from a menagerie. You must
      understand that practically all the older men here at that time had come
      from panther states back East&#8212;and, I might say, the rising
      generation had more or less been steeped in panther talk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It is written in the family records, and was generally
      known here then, that the grandmother of Bill and Ben Porter was killed
      and partly devoured by a panther back in Indiana. She would have been the
      great-grandmother of Jim and Bill Porter, and Zada Shumaker and Harry
      Porter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, there is one man now living in Wetmore&#8212;G.
      C. Swecker&#8212;who would tell you how one of those ferocious beasts
      hopped upon the roof of his father&#8217;s hunting lodge, while occupied,
      back in Virginia and ripped the clapboards off. He also declares that
      panthers do scream like a woman. And, as one old fellow around the fire
      had said, they do sometimes migrate. I myself recall that during a severe
      winter in the Rocky mountains nearly a half century ago, that those
      killers actually came right down into Colorado Springs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">At that time panthers were quite numerous in the
      Missouri hills across the river from Atchison&#8212;and with the Missouri
      river frozen in the severe winters of the old days, it would have been an
      easy matter for them to cross on the ice to this side; and then only a
      distance of forty miles to get out here. And supposing&#8212;just
      supposing&#8212;that, perchance, they might have come over in pairs, and
      carried on in the usual cat tradition, there was the bare possibility of
      our coon-hunters even running into a &#8220;family&#8221; of them. The
      panther&#8217;s young stay with the mother until grown.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Let&#8217;s say, then, that there was just enough to
      it to keep timid people on edge. I doubt if there ever was a night
      coon-hunt in those days when some of the hunters didn&#8217;t give some
      thought to that killer. The thought seemed to hit one the moment he was in
      the deep woods. And on moonlight nights that thought was simply
      unshakeable. A shadow in the wood&#8212;a shadow that was somehow alive&#8212;could
      be highly disquieting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Uncle Nick and the men, with the dogs on leash, took a
      turn about the woods while waiting for my father and the inevitable Thuse
      Peters to arrive. They would be coming out from town. I had gone out
      earlier that evening with my cousin, Burrel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Uncle Nick bade me remain at the fire so as to direct
      Dad and Thuse when, and if, they should come while the hunters were away.
      Ambrose Porter said, &#8220;Nick, you&#8217;re not going to leave that boy
      all alone out here. I&#8217;ll- stay with him.&#8221; Uncle Nick said,
      quietly, &#8220;Oh no, you won&#8217;t.&#8221; Uncle knew that Ambrose
      never liked to exert himself needlessly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">If not inclined to discount my statements</span> <span>&#8212;</span>
      <span class="c2 c0">and you really should not&#8212;you are now maybe
      thinking what I thought that night&#8212;that it was a darned shame to
      leave a boy all alone out there in the woods like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The hunters were now coming in from the north. Uncle
      Nick and the Englishmen well in front. Uncle Nick called out, &#8220;Johnny
      my boy, where are you?&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had climbed the small tree at the end of the log&#8212;as
      far up as I could go. I called back, &#8220;Up here in this tree, Uncle
      Nick. Look on the log&#8212;quick!&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The hunters had now advanced a couple of steps,
      bringing the log into view. I glanced back in time to see them shift their
      gaze from my tree-perch to the log&#8212;and I took one more look at the
      log myself, just as Uncle Nick fired his rifle. In that split second I
      could see two eyes shining brightly in the glare of the bonfire&#8212;and
      I saw the yellowish form of the ugly thing fall off the log.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Uncle Nick was a sure shot with a rifle. And quick
      too. As told in one of my former articles, he had killed a mountain lion
      in the Rockies while placer mining in Colorado in 1858. The great beast
      was shot in the nick of time&#8212;in midair, after that 200 pounds of
      destruction had made the spring for my uncle from an overhanging limb of a
      great pine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0">Addressing Uncle Nick, the little Englishman said,
      &#8220;I say, my good man, let&#8217;s &#8216;ave another one soon. Over
      in the big woods. Beard the lion in &#8216;is den, so to speak.&#8221; In
      high good humor, he shook a pudgy fist at my uncle, saying, &#8220;Hand
      mind you, if I am h</span> <span>ignored</span> <span class="c2 c0">I
      shall be disappointed.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The one mistake of the whole evening&#8212;if one can
      be sure there was a mistake&#8212;was when the hunters, after they had
      &#8220;impressed&#8221; the Englishmen with the danger of the panther to
      their dogs, turned the dogs loose on the trail of the pet coon they had
      brought into the woods at the right movement to make a &#8220;hot trail.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It had taken four yoke of oxen to plant the log&#8212;and
      my Aunt Hulda gave the men a spirited tongue-lashing for making use of one
      of her hens to bloody the trail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, imagine if you can, my uncle&#8217;s surprise
      when the next time he went over to his cherished timber lot he discovered
      that someone had robbed him of valuable post and rail trees. Not being
      present at the time, I have no way of knowing what his immediate reactions
      were. But had it been my Dad instead of my uncle, who never swore, I&#8217;m
      darned sure I could name more&#8217;n half of the irreverent words he
      would have employed in taking the epidermis off that stocky little
      Englishman.</span>

      <span class="c2 c0">The oil strike on the Oreon Strahm land one mile south
      of the Sabetha hospital, in August, 1950, and the two producers previously
      brought in on the Mamie Strahm land three and one-half miles to the
      southwest, refreshes my memory of an earlier try for oil in Nemaha County&#8212;and
      some of my own experiences in this greatest of all &#8220;get-rich-quick&#8221;
      opportunities.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In 1904 Dr. Joseph Haigh and Dr. A. P. Lapham secured
      a block of oil leases around Wetmore, and contracted with a driller, W. H.
      Hardenburg, of Oklahoma, to drill a well to the depth of 2,000 feet&#8212;or
      to the Mississippi lime&#8212;for $5,000. The site was on land owned by
      Dr. J. W. Graham in the west part of town; later owned by Mr. Mathews.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The drillers struck a little gas at 1700 feet, which
      spurted water over the 80-foot derrick. This caused a great deal of
      excitement&#8212;but after &#8220;pulling&#8221; the fire in the
      coal-burning power plant and quickly taking other precautionary measures,
      the drillers said &#8220;there was nothing to it.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Gas had previously been encountered in two water wells
      in the north part of town&#8212;on the Cyrus Clinkenbeard property west of
      the school grounds, now owned by the Thorn-burrow girls; and on the J. W.
      Luce property near the cemetery, now owned by Gene Cromwell. The flow in
      the Luce well was the stronger, agitating the water in a way to produce a
      bubbling sound. It created a lot of excitement. But the State Geologist
      said it was helium gas, which, rather than burn, would extinguish fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the oil test on the Graham lot, at about 1800 feet,
      a hard formation was encountered, which the drillers pronounced the
      Mississippi lime&#8212;but State Geologist Haworth said it was not. Then
      the drillers completed the contract at 2,000 feet. Mr. Hardenburg had a
      drilling contract coming up in Oklahoma, but he remained on the job here
      about a week longer, at $40 a day&#8212;and the hole was put down to 2225
      feet. It was planned to have Mr. Hardenburg come back and drill the test
      deeper, but he got rich in his &#8220;share-the-profits&#8221; contract in
      the Tulsa oil field&#8212;and retired to a home on &#8220;easy street&#8221;
      (Morningside Drive) in Kansas City.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When Hart Eyman was getting up a block of oil leases
      here in 1934, I called up Mr. Hardenburg, while in Kansas City, and told
      him of the activity out here. He asked me to let him know when the first
      test was to be spudded in here, saying he would drive out. He said he
      still had faith in this section and that he would have been glad to have
      finished our test. I believe our people failed to raise the necessary
      funds. The money for the original test was raised by selling stock. And it
      was a clean promotion&#8212;but that is more than I can say for some of
      the outside oil promotions in which our Wetmore group dipped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In view of the recent strikes in the Strahm field,
      with a 30-barrel producer in the Hunton lime at around 2800 feet; and the
      Mamie Strahm number 2, rated at 1440 barrels in the Viola lime at
      approximately 3600 feet; and the Oreon Strahm test, with even greater
      potential production in the Hunton and Viola and still another producing
      sand topping the granite at around 3900 feet, it looks as though we
      Wetmore &#8220;investors&#8221; might better have kept our speculative
      eggs all in one basket, so to speak, contrary to high-powered promotion
      advice&#8212;and completed the Haigh-Lapham oil test. And I still believe
      we overlooked our best bet right here at home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But then we had no data to enlighten us. The nearest
      and only drilling at that time was ten miles south of us. It was not deep
      enough to prove or disprove anything. In the heyday of his great financial
      flight&#8212;in the 1880&#8217;s&#8212;Green Campbell drilled a test to
      the depth of 1,000 feet on the east edge of Circleville. I believe the
      incentive was a reported seepage of oil in the creek south of the town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, some twenty years after the Wetmore try, a
      couple of promoters came out of Kansas City, with a plan to rejuvenate
      interests in the Haigh-Lapham test&#8212;and &#8220;feather their own
      nests.&#8221; Joe Searles&#8217; drugstore in the east room of what is now
      the First National Bank building, was the unofficial headquarters for oil
      hungry &#8220;investors&#8221;&#8212;local and transient. With Joe and the
      two promoters, I went over to the Matthews lot, now owned by Bert Gilbert.
      Mr. Hardenburg had left the top 100 feet of casing in the well to prevent
      cave-ins against the time when he might return to finish the well.
      Measurements to the exhaustion of the string available showed the well
      open for fifteen hundred feet&#8212;and likely all the way down to the
      bottom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Excitement began to mount again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Dr. A. P. Lapham presided over a packed gathering in
      the opera house&#8212;and appointed a committee of five to confer with the
      promoters. The committee met in the Thorn-burrow bank. The promoters came
      up with a contract whereby they would undertake to raise the funds for the
      completion of the well, against numerous and assorted requirements by
      &#8220;the people&#8221; of Wetmore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I was offered the trusteeship&#8212;but I declined to
      accept it. I think the reason the committee offered it to me was because I
      had been the trustee&#8212;with no part in the promotion&#8212;of a block
      of eight hundred acres of oil leases in Elk and Chautauqua Counties,
      purchased from Charley Cortner, salesman, of Iola, and Dr. C. E. Shaffer,
      vendor, of Moline, by our Wetmore group, at $10 an acre, with further
      obligation of $1.00 per acre yearly rentals, for five years, which had
      been carried through to a successful termination, with no gain to the
      &#8220;investors&#8221; and a loss to me of only $85&#8212;aside from my
      $250 first come-in and my part of the rentals, $25 a year, through
      payments of rentals in general, as trustee, in excess of collections. I
      had to collect four hundred dollars twice a year from fifty-three people&#8212;and
      I didn&#8217;t quite make it. I therefore regarded the trusteeship now
      offered me as not a desirable recognition.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">To keep the record straight, I shall now give with a
      little more enlightenment. I actually had a little velvet in the Shaffer
      oil deal&#8212;leastwise it looked like velvet at the time. Not for
      promotional influence&#8212;but for services rendered, and to be rendered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I went with Charley Cortner, the salesman, and three
      other Wetmore men to the Moline oil field&#8212;paid my own expenses, even
      to transportation equal to railroad fare, and therefore was beholden to no
      one. The Moline acreage adjoined a block of leases on which the discovery
      well, a small producer, had recently been brought in. There was, however,
      big production&#8212;and growing bigger every day&#8212;at Eldorado, where
      we stopped on the way down to get our appetites (for oil speculation)
      whetted. I wanted to go in with them, of course.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">You know, should you pass up an opportunity to go in
      with the home folks on something that was to pan out big, you would always
      feel that God had given you less sense than He had given your more
      fortunate neighbors. And, should you strive to live down the mistake,
      there would always be lucky ones to remind you of your dumbness. The hope
      of oil-money was in my system. Had been hankering to get in with the home
      folks on something good for a long time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When reminiscing for entertainment, as well as for
      record of historic fact, with no particular theme to exploit, you will,
      doubtless, agree that it is permissible&#8212;nay, oft-times necessary, to
      break all the rules laid down by learned teachers; such as to never let
      one incident call up another. And, if you don&#8217;t agree&#8212;you are
      going to get it now, anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Aside from the matter in hand, I may say that only a
      short time before this, I had been denied the chance to go with a Wetmore
      group on an inspection trip to another oil field in southern Kansas&#8212;because
      I had not as yet signed up, as they had, for an interest in the lease.
      Well, the energetic young salesman, after securing pledges enough here to
      put him in the clear, went ahead of the boys to the headquarters and
      bought the lease, at a discount, on partial payment, using his own money,
      which, had all gone well, should have netted him more than the promised
      commission. He intended, of course, to deliver the lease to the group up
      here at the contract price, or rather the pledged commitments, with only a
      few amounts yet to be peddled, or held in his own name, at his discretion.
      But the Wetmore group&#8212;the boys who had said that to let me go with
      them on the inspection trip without first making a commitment, would be
      unfair to those who had signed up&#8212;turned down the deal, cold. Then,
      after returning home, the group heard rumors of lawsuits&#8212;and counter
      suits. The lease vendor was demanding payment in full, and the poor
      boy-salesman could not raise the money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Cortner, the salesman earlier mentioned in
      this writing, had been here for five or six months selling life insurance.
      He was a whole-souled, persuasive, sort of man who had made many friends
      here. Cortner and Dr. J. R. Purdum, in whose car the trip to Moline had
      been made, went out among the people and in almost no time secured pledges
      for nearly enough money to take over the Shaffer leases. They were selling
      interests in $125 &#8220;units.&#8221; But, at the finish, to accommodate
      all the eager applicants, some subscriptions were taken for as little as
      $50 and $25&#8212;sub-divisions of a unit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When they came to me&#8212;at the corn-house, where I
      had been sorting out seed corn&#8212;I surprised them (and maybe shocked
      them, too) by declining to subscribe. Not that I didn&#8217;t want to get
      in on the big prospect&#8212;but because, as I believe, it was an improper
      if not a dangerous way to form a syndicate. Somewhere I had acquired the
      notion that if fifty people chipped in and bought a thing that it would
      take fifty people to sell it. But I didn&#8217;t tell them this until
      after they had &#8220;flared up&#8221; and had their say. They started to
      quit me, in disgust&#8212;but the Doctor, who was regarded among my best
      friends, thinking to erase some of the unkind comment, said, &#8220;Well,
      John, when you get through sorting your sour corn, come and see us&#8212;we&#8217;ll
      save some units for you.&#8221; My corn was not &#8220;sour&#8221; corn.
      It was well matured, and making an average of eighty bushels, with some
      acres on grubbed ground making 125 bushels.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, for a little laughable reaction within a none too
      laughable story. The Farmers Union elevator manager, a farmer not so long
      out of the corn rows, refused to buy my culled corn, said it would be
      unfair to his company to permit me to take out the best ears. After I had
      sent several loads to the Netawaka elevator, as it accumulated in the
      house, after taking out only about ten per cent, the Farmers Union manager
      came over to the corn house, looked at the culled corn we were loading out
      at the moment, saying he guessed maybe he had made a mistake in refusing
      to buy the culled corn. The culled corn was far better than the general
      run of corn brought to market that year. It was an improved strain of
      Boone County White, which would shell out equal to Reid&#8217;s Yellow
      Dent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">While still at the corn-house that day of the
      Purdum-Cortner call, Charley had an inspiration. He said, &#8220;Why
      couldn&#8217;t you write something for us like you think we ought to have?&#8221;
      I said, &#8220;I can try&#8212;but it will have to be approved by an
      attorney before you can use it. I don&#8217;t want to cook up something
      that might get our people in trouble.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But did I&#8212;or did I not?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley said, &#8220;Can you get at it right away?&#8221;
      So the &#8220;sour&#8221; corn sorting was postponed until another day&#8212;and
      I went to my home at 11:15. My typewriter and writing desk were in an
      alcove up stairs. I had hardly gotten the corn-dust and the insult to my
      purebred seed corn, which had been engendered within the hour at the seed
      house out of my system when my wife came to the stair door and said dinner
      was ready. I had no time for dinner. The necessary words had not come to
      me readily. Charley came at 12:30, sat close to me, in a more pleasant
      mood with occasional verbal expression indicating the reason for the
      improvement. But he was careful to hold back the main reason. His presence
      didn&#8217;t help in furthering the writing. However, we got away at the
      appointed time&#8212;one o&#8217;clock. No dinner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Fred Woodburn, the corporation-wise member of
      Wood-burn &amp; Woodburn, lawyers, Holton, Kansas, approved my draft, as
      written, with one exception. I had made provision for transfer of units.
      Fred said it would break the partnership. And, may I say, before I forget
      it, that I was censured for being so careless as to omit making provision
      for transfers&#8212;and this, too, by an individual who, as you will
      hereinafter see recorded, found fault with my correct line of reasoning in
      another instance&#8212;correct as in reference to the one incident,
      understand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I&#8217;m not trying to &#8220;hand&#8221; myself a
      bouquet. The agreement cooked up by me was neither &#8220;air tight&#8221;
      nor &#8220;fool proof.&#8221; The Trustee had not a chance. The error was
      that I did not require the subscribers to include in their checks a
      sufficiency to take care of their rentals for the full life of the leases.
      True, there was the chance that rental payments might be legitimately
      discontinued before the expiration of the lease, as in case of production
      terminating the payments, or disposition of the lease. But it would have
      been a lot simpler and safer too for the Trustee to return the unearned
      portion of the lease money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Charley Cortner paid the Woodburns for writing a new
      draft of the agreement&#8212;and asked me, on the road home, for my
      charge. I told him, &#8220;No charge.&#8221; He thanked me kindly. He felt
      good of course&#8212;but I could see he had not yet got all he needed to
      allay a worry, the thing that had hit them so hard at the corn-house.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Unauthorized, and unknown to me, in soliciting
      subscriptions, it seems, they had carried the impression, if not the
      promise, that I would be the Trustee&#8212;possibly demanded by some of
      the prospects. After miles of silence on the road, Charley said, &#8220;You
      know, I feel so good about this that I&#8217;m going to give you one unit;
      you can have it in cash, or in stock in the syndicate.&#8221; From the
      ultra pleased expression on his face when I said I would take it in stock,
      I&#8217;m sure he had been holding his breath awaiting my decision.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">True, I had not as yet agreed to accept the
      Trusteeship&#8212;in fact, I knew nothing about their plans&#8212;but I
      was now as good as in, and they could, at least, make a plausible showing
      at the called meeting in the City Hall the following night, when the
      vendor would appear in person to deliver the leases. Charley&#8217;s gift
      to me was acceptable grapes&#8212;equal to $4.50 a line, or 45 cents a
      word for the writing. I really wanted to get in, and would have subscribed
      for an interest, anyway&#8212;now that apparently a safe and workable
      organization would be formed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, Doctor Shaffer spent much of his time here in my
      home. He was agreeably pleased over Charley Cortner&#8217;s work, with my
      assistance in preparing the agreement&#8212;and said so in no unmistakable
      terms. He had a pleasant word for my wife, too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In an aside, I will say, that while in Moline on that
      inspection trip, I was troubled with a slight attack of appendicitis&#8212;which
      had been chronic with me for twenty years, and still is&#8212;and had
      gotten temporary relief from the Doctor. Dr. Shaffer now said that should
      I ever decide to have an operation, for me to come down to Moline, and
      bring my wife along, that she could stay in the hospital&#8212;all free of
      charge. This was by far the best offer I had ever had.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">First, I might say Dr. Sam Murbock, our old reliable,
      had said he could not tell me what his charge would be until he got into
      me. I told him that he would never get into me, or my pocket, without
      first naming his price.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, when a guest at the Stratford hotel in Kansas
      City, Dr. Pickerel, of the Stratford, went with me to the University
      Hospital early one morning. He said he would sit awhile in the lobby and
      he would spot the surgeons as they came in. I passed three of them, trying
      to get my nerves settled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The fourth one was more in general appearance to my
      idea of what a good surgeon should look like. He was called&#8212;and we
      went up stairs to a room. On examination, Dr. Jabes Jackson, Kansas City&#8217;s
      top-notch surgeon, said I was just right for the operation. I asked him
      what would be his charge? He said, &#8220;One thousand dollars!&#8221; I
      told him that I would have to be a lot sicker before I would think of
      giving up a thousand dollars. Then, Dr. Pickerel said, &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t
      come under that class, doctor.&#8221; Dr. Jabes then said, &#8220;Three
      hundred&#8212;that&#8217;s the lowest.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Again, while at the Byram hotel in Atchison I had a
      severe attack in the night&#8212;and believed that the time had come when
      I should have the old appendix taken out. I called for Atchison&#8217;s
      foremost surgeon. He was in Kansas City, but would be back at one o&#8217;clock.
      I went up to the Atchison hospital in the forenoon, asked for a little
      &#8220;home&#8221; treatment. In bed, the nurse felt my &#8220;tummy,&#8221;
      shook her head, and said, &#8220;You will have to wait for your doctor.&#8221;
      The doctor said I could have the caster oil and an enema&#8212;but he told
      the nurse I was to have no breakfast. In the morning, I was feeling pretty
      good and was about out of the notion of having the operation. However, I
      asked the doctor what would be his charge? He said, &#8220;You are most
      too weak to stand it now. Come back in a week&#8212;we&#8217;ll talk it
      over then.&#8221; One week later, the doctor said, &#8220;Owing to your
      long residence in the state, and your standing in the community, I&#8217;ll
      do it for five hundred dollars.&#8221; I recalled that our old Nemaha
      County reliable had done the job for one of my friends for a very
      reasonable fee, and also remembered that he had charged others less
      reasonable. I said, &#8220;If and when the time comes, I&#8217;ll just
      give you $150.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it&#8212;but if you
      ever tell anybody, I&#8217;ll kick your butt all over town.&#8221; You may
      know that we were on quite intimate terms, having on earlier occasions met
      at Atchison&#8217;s friendly club&#8212;or he wouldn&#8217;t have dared to
      talk to me like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Back in my home again, after enthusiastically
      discussing the likely prospect of the new oil field. Doctor Shaffer went
      out on the street to mingle with his boys, and the prospects who were now
      coming in from as far away as Holton, Circleville, Soldier, Corning, Goff,
      Netawaka, Whiting, Sabetha, and intervening farms&#8212;including my
      long-time friend Tommy Evans, whose farm north of Capioma had the
      reputation of being the best kept and most productive in the neighborhood&#8212;saying
      he (the doctor) would be back soon. My wife said, &#8220;It looked like
      your promoter friends have all ready unintentionally cut you in on the big
      melon should you be mindful to follow up the lead&#8212;and wish to be
      bothered with the Trusteeship.&#8221; She laughed, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t
      make that Doctor Shaffer cut you in for a generous slice you are not as
      smart as I think you are.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, maybe I needed this tip&#8212;and maybe I didn&#8217;t.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Doctor Shaffer came back, and without more
      preliminaries, proposed to cut me in for two units ($250) if I would
      prepare him two copies in blank, of the agreement I had cooked up for the
      home syndicate, and, incidentally, permit Cortner and Purdum to make good
      on their promise to the subscribers that I would be the Trustee. He said
      they were expecting it, and desired to have my acceptance before going
      into the meeting. Thus, I wouldn&#8217;t rightly know to whom I was
      indebted for the generous slice of the melon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Or was it a melon?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I suspect it was as Myrtle had said, unintentionally
      cooked up by the two solicitors&#8212;and that, in its final phase, it was
      a joint settlement, with the solicitors having to kick back a portion of
      their rake-off. Anyway, it was more unsolicited grapes for me&#8212;twice
      over the $4.50 a line, or 45 cents a word for the original draft. I used a
      carbon and made the two new copies at once, while Doctor Shaffer waited.
      He had another sale on with a Missouri group.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Fifty-three subscribers crowded into the City Hall,
      and all signed the agreement, and each set down the amount of his
      subscription opposite his name&#8212;and all wrote checks. At the finish I
      had fifty-three checks totaling $8,000&#8212;my own check for $250, and
      Doctor Shaffer&#8217;s check for $1,000, included. Doctor Shaffer would
      reimburse me for this $250 and also pay me the $125 promised by Charley
      Cortner. I was instructed to send payment for the lease in two $4,000 bank
      drafts. I had no intention of paying out $8,000 until those checks had
      time to be cleared. In the meantime our attorney had called for complete
      abstracts to the acreage instead of the certificates of title supplied by
      the vendor&#8212;delaying settlement for several weeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But the eight thousand dollar payment was made, and I
      received the $375 velvet from Doctor Shaffer&#8212;I guess. For reasons of
      his own, unknown to me, Dr. Shaffer had a Wichita man mail me his personal
      check for $375, nothing more. I suspect one of those $4,000 drafts had
      been deposited in a Wichita bank. The transaction was legitimate. I had
      nothing to cover up. This payment to me had come off the salesman and the
      vendor, negotiated subsequent to the pledges made by syndicate members&#8212;leaving
      their full &#8220;investment&#8221; intact to work out its own salvation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">This is the God&#8217;s truth&#8212;and mine, too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Now, kindly figure out for me, if you can, where
      anyone had been worsted through my part in the transaction. Two &#8220;bright&#8221;
      young clerks in the bank here&#8212;whom I shall not name&#8212;caught it
      at once. That mysterious $375 check had alerted them. They put their own
      erroneous construction on it&#8212;and passed the word along. Then I
      caught &#8220;hail Columbia&#8221; from the younguns&#8217; superior (in
      point of banking tenure) who had &#8220;invested $125 in his wife&#8217;s
      name&#8212;the idea being that a banker himself ought to have more sense
      than to dabble in such matters. His &#8220;boys,&#8221; as he called them,
      meant well, of course&#8212;and it didn&#8217;t take me too long to
      convince the banker that I had taken no part in the promotion. But, what
      if I had? It would not have been a crime. I want to say, however, that the
      banker did me the favor of trying to correct the false impressions he had
      helped set afloat. Once in a blue moon even the worst of us will meet such
      a manful man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In this story I only aim to hit the high spots&#8212;not,
      at any time, deviating from the truth. It was not all easy sailing for the
      Trustee. In a case of this kind, the conscientious person representing his
      friends, does not wish to let them down because of failure to collect
      rentals in full. With syndicate members widely scattered, the Trustee must
      make his own decisions&#8212;and quick. He can put up the delinquent
      amount himself, or he can forfeit the lease&#8212;if he does not wish to
      raise the ire of his friends who have paid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our syndicate was in reality an unfinanced holding
      partnership&#8212;barred from creating indebtedness, euphoniously
      christened &#8220;The Elkmore Oil and Gas Syndicate.&#8221; Here, I must
      give the wife credit&#8212;if, in the long run it really merited credit&#8212;for
      suggesting this expressive name, which embraces, in split infinitives, the
      location of the lease holdings (Elk County) and the home (Wetmore) of the
      &#8220;investors.&#8221; It pleased Dr. Shaffer&#8212;no end. I think it
      got Myrtle included in that proposed free entertainment at his hospital in
      Moline.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Like Doctor Purdum&#8217;s good natured crack at my
      purebred seed corn, those altruistically donated helpings of &#8220;grapes&#8221;
      showered on me by Cortner and Shaffer, had begun to &#8220;sour&#8221;&#8212;and,
      I may say, that they deteriorated until less than nothing was left of the
      windfall. It posed a perplexing dilemma.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">As there was little chance of getting action before
      the expiration of the leases, aggravated by draggy collections of rentals,
      a feeler was mailed to all subscribers, in ample time before the fifth
      year&#8217;s payments were due. More than half of them favored dropping
      the leases, and sent me their written authorization. Nearly half of the
      interests remained expressionless. The four leases were canceled. The
      majority of the interests wished it so. But, it was the delinquents who
      hollered most, even censured me for giving up the lease&#8212;when some of
      the acreage came into production several years later. It seemed not to
      have occurred to them that wo would have lost out, anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But, in the Moline field we got some experience which
      should have taught us a lesson, that a bird in hand is worth a whole flock
      in the bush&#8212;but it didn&#8217;t. We could have sold our leases at a
      nice profit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">An oil gusher was brought in on a large tract of
      pasture land one mile away from our holdings. Dr. Shaffer wired me to come
      down at once. He drove me out to the well. There was a terrific jam&#8212;at
      the well, on the road, in Moline. Crowds of people were at the well ahead
      of us that morning&#8212;Art Hough, a former Wetmore boy, and his oil-rich
      partner, from Independence, among them. Excitement was running high. One
      man was killed in his overturned car while rushing out from town. And I,
      myself, spent the night in a Moline hospital. This fact, however, does not
      necessarily pertain to the gusher&#8212;except to show that there was
      genuine good-feeling all round. I was the guest of Dr. Shaffer and his
      wife, who were the only other occupants of his new hospital, not yet ready
      for public patronage. Dr. Shaffer owned a one-eighth interest in our
      leases.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">If you have never seen an oil-gusher, you don&#8217;t
      know what a thrilling sight it is&#8212;especially, if you own nearby
      leases. Oil spurted in gusts at regular intervals high into the air,
      spread out in all directions and arched down over the four case-setters,
      stripped to the waist, encasing them in a film of oil so heavy as to
      exclude them from view, at times. Art Hough and his partner, who owned
      some producing wells in the shallow field near Independence, wanted to buy
      our leases&#8212;but who would want to sell in the midst of all that
      excitement? And, anyway, I was not in a position to deal with them on the
      spot, as there were fifty-three signers in the group to an agreement which
      provided for fifty-one per cent of the interests to say when to sell. We
      did, however, later, arrange to sell part of the leases&#8212;carrying a
      provision for drilling&#8212;and the papers were sent to the Moline bank;
      but the prospective buyer was unable to come through with the money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The gusher was on land owned, or controlled, by a
      Moline banker, and another man. I heard one of the partners say, not once
      but many times, always the same sing-song word for word, &#8220;I just
      told the Lord that since He had been so good to me, I shall never
      desecrate His holy name.&#8221; If I may express myself, unbiasedly, I
      would say the Lord played no favorites in the Moline field; that I think
      He had nothing to do with the man&#8217;s good luck, except, possibly, in
      a general way of being the creator of all things&#8212;else why would He
      have destroyed the gusher with salt-water, and got the owners the threat
      of a robust lawsuit to boot&#8212;for polluting a God-given stream of
      fresh water?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In the matter of a fresh try to reopen the Wetmore oil
      test, I protested the contract offered by the two Kansas City promoters,
      maintaining that we had no valid authority to sign anything in the name of
      &#8220;the people&#8221; and that liability would fall on the individual
      signers. One of the committeemen who had been in various lines of business
      in Wetmore, and had finally settled himself in a real estate office, said,
      &#8220;Why, John&#8212;there haint a day but what I make contracts like
      that.&#8221; Questioning the man&#8217;s competency in such matters, I
      said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it in the least&#8212;but it will take
      still more plausible argument to induce me to sign this one.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The other members of the committee had caught the
      spirit of the meeting in the opera house, and were anxious to see further
      development of our oil prospect. They conferred the &#8220;favor&#8221; of
      the trusteeship on committeeman Sam Thornburrow, cashier of the State Bank&#8212;and
      they all signed the contract. Then the promoters went back to Kansas City
      to await the hatching of the egg they had laid here. And in due time, Sam
      got notice from a lawyer in Kansas City that he was about to be sued for
      breach of contract. Then one morning as I was passing the bank Sam hailed
      me. He said, &#8220;You know, those Kansas City fellows have sued me for
      $1,000&#8212;what would you do about it?&#8221; Remembering how they had
      &#8220;ribbed&#8221; me for refusing to sign with them, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d
      pay it.&#8221; After he had turned this over in his troubled mind a few
      times, I told him to pay no attention to it&#8212;that the promoters were
      most likely trying to frighten him into a settlement; that they would have
      to start their action in Kansas&#8212;and that I doubted very much if they
      would risk doing this, as the contract would show them up for the grafters
      they were.&#8221; The Kansas City promoters did not follow through with
      their claim for damages.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It took only one more throw at the get-rich-quick oil
      game to convince me that it just could not be accomplished by throwing in
      with the other fellow on his home grounds, after he had carried the
      project to a point where any day&#8217;s drilling might bring riches. But
      I&#8217;m still strong on the home-test&#8212;for that would be furthering
      something for the good of all the home folks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our Wetmore group, with &#8220;investors&#8221; at
      Goff and Bancroft, contributed a sum said to be $14,350 toward the
      completion of a well in a producing field east of Enid, Oklahoma, on land
      owned by a Bancroft man. The headquarters of the Company was in a fair
      sized city in southern Kansas, with a department store owner as president,
      a physician and surgeon as secretary&#8212;and a banker deeply interested
      in a covered-up sort of way. The president and the land owner had
      departed with our money, supposedly to complete the well&#8212;and then we
      would all most likely be &#8220;sitting pretty.&#8221; But in about a week
      we got notice of a called meeting to vote $30,000 increase in capital
      stock. Also, we were advised of the bringing in of a gas well of ten
      million feet potential on the lease adjoining the company ground on the
      south, still farther away from the known production area on the north,
      proving that we were still &#8220;sitting pretty.&#8221; Had this been
      reported before we joined-up with our Southern Kansas financiers, I, for
      one, would have kept my money. Sane people do not let the public in on a
      speculative enterprise after its success is practically assured.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Our Wetmore &#8220;investors&#8221;, gave me proxies,
      and sent me down to investigate. I first went with the land-owner to the
      Oklahoma field. We found no activity at the well on his land, but the rig
      was still up. And the drillers were working on the reported gas strike
      just across the road. They told me that they had struck a small flow of
      gas&#8212;that it was not strong enough to blow your hat off the casing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I got back to the Kansas headquarters on Saturday
      about noon, and went at once to the department store owned by the
      president. He introduced his wife, who worked in the store, and his
      father-in-law, whom I shall call Mr. Shapp&#8212;though this is not his
      real name. The president insisted that I take dinner with him at his home.
      I sensed something was wrong&#8212;but I couldn&#8217;t place it just yet.
      I learned later that Dr. Lapham had got wise to something pertaining to
      the call for an increase of capital stock, and had written him a critical
      letter. Dr. Lapham told me later that it was a &#8220;scorcher&#8221;&#8212;and
      I can well believe it was. They were all rather upset. Of course the
      president, and the secretary, and the banker, knew some things which I
      didn&#8217;t know&#8212;yet. My dinner host was a bit &#8220;jumpy&#8221;
      because of that &#8220;scorcher&#8221; letter of Dr. Lap-ham&#8217;s, and
      my appearance two days in advance of the called meeting. But had he known
      what I had just learned at the dinner table, he could have trusted me
      implicitly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Some years prior to this I had sold, through
      advertisement in the Topeka Capital, 500 shares of our mining stock to the
      fictitious Monroe P. Shapp, of that address, and through him 200 shares in
      the name of his daughter, Ella J. Shapp. Now, when the merchant called his
      wife &#8220;Ella&#8221; I put two and two together&#8212;then I knew that
      I was among old friends. And I couldn&#8217;t find it in my heart to get
      rough with them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Not that I had any apologies to make for our mine
      promotion. We had used their money, as promised, in the development of the
      mine, and at this time were still putting our own money into it&#8212;and
      we had no intention of going out and selling a block of stock to rub out
      the deficit. That would have been illegal in Nevada. But the fact remained
      that we had not as yet been able to make any returns to stockholders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">When I called on the secretary of the oil company, he
      said he could not give me any time that afternoon, that he had to perform
      an operation at the hospital at 4 o&#8217;clock. I said to him, in the
      presence of the president, &#8220;You fellows seem to be scared about
      something&#8212;but you need not be. I give you my word that I am not here
      to make trouble. All I want to know is what chance you have to make good,
      and if it will be to our interests for me to vote my proxies for the
      increase of capital stock at the meeting Monday.&#8221; The secretary
      looked at the president, and the president looked at the secretary&#8212;then
      they both looked at me. The president nodded&#8212;and the secretary said,
      &#8220;Come along with me.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">It seems the directors had carried on with the
      drilling after company funds were exhausted, incurring personal
      obligations, and stopped the drill when approximating the required depth
      for a strike, with a large deficit&#8212;which, with our contribution, was
      now reduced to something like $9,000. While in the office of the
      physician-surgeon-secretary going over the books, the banker&#8212;of
      German extraction, if not the whole thing&#8212;came in, and nodding
      toward a back room, said as if in great distress, &#8220;Dokther&#8212;I&#8217;ve
      got a stick in the eye.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I decided that I ought not vote for the increase of
      stock&#8212;and, without leave, came home on Sunday. One of our group, an
      ex-businessman, attended the meeting on his own hook to get first hand
      knowledge of the situation. He wired Joe Searles Monday afternoon, saying,
      &#8220;Bristow absent; could I vote the proxies?&#8221; I told Joe to wire
      him, &#8220;Yes&#8212;if you have them.&#8221; I had just turned them in
      to Joe. In a couple of days Searles got a long letter from him&#8212;written
      by a stenographer in Kansas City&#8212;berating me for running out on
      them, and boasting of the business-like interest he himself had taken in
      the meeting, saying, &#8220;I stayed with them until we got in proxies
      enough the next day to get the money&#8212;and I bought $250 worth more of
      the stock.&#8221; He did not say&#8212;probably didn&#8217;t know&#8212;if
      his purchase was of the newly voted stock, or from the old issue. I had a
      strong suspicion that we had all ready bought and paid for a generous take
      of the newly voted stock&#8212;and got short changed as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I had called on that &#8220;stick-in-the-eye&#8221;
      banker a short while before, and obtained from him the log of a producing
      well recently brought in by Frank Letson and associates in the Enid field&#8212;and
      this, I think, might have been what had alerted the banker; or, maybe, the
      president had sent his partner scurrying in to forestall an admission of
      their questionable finagling. I wanted that log to compare with the log of
      &#8220;our&#8221; drilling, which I had obtained from &#8220;our&#8221;
      president. Then, too, Frank Letson was a younger brother of Ed and Ella
      Letson who were my schoolmates in Wetmore, when their father, Bill Letson,
      owned a general store here; before going to Netawaka to engage in like
      business. I had called at the Fleming and Letson bank in Enid two days
      before, but did not get to see either of my old acquaintances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Fleming bank, now an imposing brick structure
      having tall columns, on the east side of the square, was started on the
      south side, opposite the land office, in a small frame building in the new
      town after the opening of the Cherokee strip, in 1893. I also had occasion
      to call at the old bank about six months after the opening, to get a paper
      notarized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Attorney Elwin Campfield, in the law office of John
      Curran, formerly of Seneca, on the west side of the Enid square, filled
      out relinquishing papers for me, without charge&#8212;we had been
      neighbors in the Bleisener building in Wetmore&#8212;and suggested that I
      wait in the Curran office a few minutes when he would have one of the
      office force notarize it for me, presumedly also without charge&#8212;a
      small matter hardly worth waiting for. Up here the fee for such service
      was then, and still is, twenty-five cents. I told Elwin I would go over to
      the Fleming bank and get it notarized, that I wanted to pay my respects to
      Ollie, anyway. 01 had grabbed off, at Netawaka, a red headed girl (Ella
      Letson) whom I had thought pretty nice when we were care-free kids running
      wild on the streets of Wetmore in the early days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Well, 01 was sure glad to see me&#8212;and he would
      gladly remember me to Ella. When he had returned the notarized paper to
      me, I said, &#8220;How much, 01?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Five dollars!&#8221;
      I shot him a wordless blank look. He laughed, and said, &#8220;Oh, give me
      two-and-a-half.&#8221; There had been a time in that frontier town when
      one could get most anything asked for services, but that time was now over
      and passed&#8212;half-over, anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">That officious Wetmore man was in Dr. Lapham&#8217;s
      office when I reported my findings. I told the group that I had spoken
      only for myself when I gave those finaglers my word that I was not there
      to make trouble&#8212;that I had to do this to get them to open up. I told
      the group that I had no desire to pursue the matter further, but that they
      themselves were not barred; that any one of them who might wish to, could
      notify the Blue Sky Board in Topeka&#8212;and the Board would do the rest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The man who had taken matters in his own hands and
      helped put over the vote for the increase of capital stock without the
      formality of first finding out what it was all about, popped up and said,
      &#8220;You had no right to tell them that.&#8221; He insisted that I
      should make the complaint. And the surprising thing is, he had some
      supporters. There were some hard losers in the group. I had not made the
      investigation with the intention of filing a complaint&#8212;wouldn&#8217;t
      have accepted the assignment had it carried any such provision. I don&#8217;t
      like fussing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, too, the president and the land owner had not
      solicited me to buy stock, nor made promise to me that the fund would be
      used to complete the well. Their contact had been with Dr. Lapham and
      other members of the group. I went in with them solely because my
      neighbors had invited me to join them, and because I didn&#8217;t want to
      stand idly by&#8212;and watch them make a &#8220;killing.&#8221; However,
      on invitation, I went up to Dr. Lapham&#8217;s office at the virtual close
      of a &#8220;pep&#8221; meeting, after the check-writing had begun. I asked
      for information as to how the company was organized&#8212;particularly as
      to whether or not the stock was non-assessable? The president and the
      land-owner really didn&#8217;t know. But they went to Topeka the next day
      and secured a transcript of the incorporation papers, which were
      acceptable. And I was invited to go before the adjourned meeting the
      following evening, and voice my approval. Then the check writing was
      resumed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, my conscience told me, in a flash, that it would
      be a rather poor spirited person who should wish to send his neighbor
      &#8220;up&#8221; for the mistake of keeping bad company. It looked as if
      our old farmer-neighbor had been caught in between two fires, and didn&#8217;t
      know which way to &#8220;jump&#8221;&#8212;or worse still, that there was
      now no open way out. Thus, it may be said, that our old Bancroft
      farmer-friend, in his most uncomfortable position, was comparable to the
      banker held as hostage by a bold gang of robbers who had just looted his
      bank. I know. I spent two days with the dispirited old man in the oil
      field.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Blue Sky Board was fostered to check on promotions
      whose stocks were strongly, if not wholly, tinctured with the azure blue.
      Along about 1905-06-07 questionable promotions&#8212;mostly mining&#8212;sprang
      up all over the country. Kansas City had several going full blast at one
      time. I had occasion to call on one of them; had arranged the meeting
      through correspondence. I entered a very large room where perhaps thirty
      or forty girl-typists were busily preparing literature to be sent out by
      mail to inquirers secured through newspaper advertisements. The printed
      portion of the literature had been prepared by &#8220;experts&#8221;
      copy-writers&#8212;and it is surprising how those fellows could make an
      inferior proposition appeal to the gullible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The Fiscal Agent&#8217;s secretary, or outside girl,
      stationed near his private office&#8212;he had a better looking secretary
      in his office&#8212;said she believed the &#8220;boss&#8221; was not in. I
      gave her my name and stated my business. She went into the private office,
      and returned saying, Mr. so-and-so would see me. However, had I been a
      questionable caller, the outside girl would have told me upon returning
      that he was not in, and that she had learned from his inside secretary
      that he had gone out of town and would not be back that day. This was the
      system. The &#8220;boss&#8221; did not want to see any of his subscribers&#8212;nor
      an officer of the law.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">One of those Kansas City promotion companies was
      selling stock in what was called a Ten Million Dollar Development&#8212;that
      is, ten million shares, par-value one dollar, sold at two cents a share,
      the idea being to offer the purchaser a lot for little money, out in our
      mining district in Nevada. It was highly advertised as the &#8220;Extension
      of the Great (Searchlight) Quartette Vein.&#8221; The outfit was actually
      sinking a shaft about a half-mile out in the valley west of the
      mountain-situated Quartette mine&#8212;a rich gold producer&#8212;without
      reasonable chance of picking up anything in the way of values. Too many
      promotions like this were victimizing the people. The Blue Sky Board&#8217;s
      function was to keep them out of Kansas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In our own mine promotion, I did some newspaper
      advertising in Topeka&#8212;but, first, I had to get a clearance from the
      Blue Sky Board (in Bank Commissioner Dolley&#8217;s office) showing that
      our company was on the square; that the stock was a fair risk; that
      purchasers were fully and truthfully informed; and most important of all,
      that the purchasers would get a run for their money&#8212;meaning that the
      money so collected must not be used in paying for a &#8220;dead horse.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">On full-page advertising in a number of papers, I
      received on the average one inquiry for each 3,000 circulation&#8212;but I
      sold practically all of them. This was only about one-hundredth part of
      the returns the Kansas City fellows were getting. And I had strong copy,
      too. The newspaper boys said it was unusually strong. But I made the
      mistake&#8212;from the promoter&#8217;s view point&#8212;of telling the
      readers the truth, that we had not carried the proposition to a point
      where we were about ready to begin handing out dividends, which was the
      Kansas City boy&#8217;s big drawing card. This was costing too much&#8212;and
      I discontinued selling the stock, hoping that we might yet find an Agent
      who would have better luck. We used up the funds on hand; then went at it
      individually again. And the six miners continued on the job, taking their
      full wages in our treasury stock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Let it be understood that the mining stock I sold was
      far from being in the blue sky class&#8212;and that the job of selling it
      was &#8220;wished&#8221; on me. While in the process of incorporating, our
      president, Frank Williams, had made tentative arrangements with Los
      Angeles &#8220;Fiscal Agents&#8221;&#8212;that&#8217;s what they called
      themselves then&#8212;to sell our treasury stock, but failed to conclude a
      satisfactory contract with them. He had encountered the same questionable
      line of approach out there that caused me to turn down the Kansas City
      &#8220;Fiscal Agents.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Might say that in the first place, on his
      recommendation, I had joined Frank Williams in the purchase of the initial
      lead-zinc-vanadium claim&#8212;only lead discovered then&#8212;on which
      our corporation was mainly based. Included in the corporation also were
      three (gold) claims in the Crescent district, owned by Frank and his
      brother Tommy Williams, A. M. Harter, and Jonah Jones. These Crescent
      claims were taken in on a basis of one-sixth of the combined value. Our
      lead claim had the further approval of that veteran millionaire miner,
      Green Campbell&#8212;indeed, had he not died suddenly of pneumonia, Green,
      instead of I, would have been Frank&#8217;s partner. Frank had been with
      Green Campbell, and his uncle Elwood Thomas&#8212;all three of the men
      former Wetmore citizens, in the Goodsprings district for twelve years, at
      that time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Then, too, those Crescent gold claims held appeal.
      What think you that your heart would have done to you, had you been able
      to go out on your own holdings and scrape up dirt&#8212;disintegrated
      rock, assaying $544 gold to the ton&#8212;at a time when the fabulous
      production of the not too distant Comstock mines in Nevada, with less
      glowing beginning, was being proclaimed all over the land as having saved
      the credit of the Nation during Civil War days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And, by the way, isn&#8217;t it about time for us to
      dig again?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Please&#8212;somebody, anybody, everybody&#8212;pray
      with me for a redeeming Comstock as of yore, only let it be such stepped
      up magnitude as to save, beyond the possibility of a slip, the credit of
      our Uncle Sam, even in his magnanimous undertaking to tide, piggyback, all
      those unstable old country states over the troubled waters of world unrest&#8212;in
      an effort to convince a certain belligerent-minded Old World character
      that war is, a la Sherman, indeed &#8220;hell.&#8221;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">But remember, mines are made&#8212;not found.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Before incorporating, we (Frank and I), worked the
      lead claim for nearly two years&#8212;or rather, Frank did the work and I
      paid him one-half of the prevailing miner&#8217;s wage. We were trying our
      best to make a paying mine of it&#8212;and may I say that, encouraged by
      occasional shipments, there were times when we believed we were right at
      the door of accomplishment.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The point I&#8217;m trying to stress here is, that we
      did not acquire the mining claims for the purpose of launching a
      stock-selling enterprise, as was so of ter done about that time. But we
      learned that more often than not even promising mining prospects require
      the expenditure of more money than we, as individuals, could devote to it&#8212;hence
      the incorporation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Thus it is that, in the fullness of Time, I have tried
      mining&#8212;to the tune of Six Thousand Dollars, plus; out of pocket&#8212;and
      I&#8217;ve tried oil, not once but three times; and I&#8217;ve even tried
      real estate speculation in the boom days of Port Arthur, Texas&#8212;all
      avenues leading up to the coveted get-rich-quick-field&#8212;and so help
      me, I have never taken down a dollar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">I promised my companion of the day that I wouldn&#8217;t
      tell about our &#8220;investments&#8221; in Port Arthur town lots. But
      that was a long time ago, between the time he was elected Governor of
      Kansas, from Nemaha County, and the time he served as Governor of the
      Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Missouri. So I opine that it doesn&#8217;t
      matter now, since he is safely beyond the pale of political patronage. In
      the new boom town of Port Arthur that warm January day about the turn of
      the century, the &#8220;boomers&#8221; showed us the location, with rock
      foundation all ready in place, for a bank building, with brick enough
      piled on the site to build an edifice big enough to house all the money in
      the world. But the most revealing report I ever got from my friend, the
      Governor, on our investments, was that the restless bank foundation and
      its companion brick pile had gone on the prowl, virtually slipped from one
      end of the plotted business section to the other end, taking now and then
      a rest period.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">The old regulars in our group of &#8220;investors&#8221;
      are about all dead now&#8212;or have dropped the Big Idea. Joe Searles, at
      present prescription clerk in a Sabetha drugstore, never in too deeply
      with the old group, is in line to get his now. He has taken on both leases
      and royalties in the Strahm field. The development so far has been done by
      the Carter Oil Company, holding most of the leases. But private interests
      are trafficking in royalties in a big way. Should Joe make good&#8212;that
      is, break into the big money where the Internal Revenue take would warrant
      him in throwing away a portion of his winnings in &#8220;wildcatting,&#8221;
      I suggest that he come home&#8212;and finish the Haigh-Lapham oil test.
      This&#8212;and other betterments for the old home town&#8212;is what I
      planned on doing, had I become burdened with mine-made money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">Also, let it be understood that I took no part in the
      organization of our group of &#8220;investors,&#8221; or the promotion of
      any of our oil speculations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">And now a last word.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3" id="h.gjdgxs">
      <span class="c2 c0">Since it appeared that our Southern Kansas co-partners
      had risked their own money, or more likely their credit, in completing the
      drilling, incurring disappointment&#8212;and, crowded by an unseen hand,
      (which I believe I could have put my finger on), had taken the wrong way
      out of the dilemma, and if I were not mistaken they yet had a long, long
      way to go to get out of the woods; so then, let us be lenient. Why say an
      unkind word about your neighbor&#8212;when it gets you nothing? Don&#8217;t
      know if they ever sold any more of the newly voted stock, or if they did
      any more drilling. Never heard from them again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"></p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c2 c0">In tolerance of human frailty, let me say that our old
      Bancroft farmer-friend, allied with keener personalities, had always been
      a reputable man&#8212;that the doctor-secretary, and the merchant-prince
      apparently stood high among their fellowmen&#8212;and then there was Ella
      J., holder of some mining stock. But, even so, had I not lost interest in
      the investigation, considered it hopeless, I believe I could have found
      &#8220;sticks&#8221; in more than one eye.</span>
